<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first impression of this work
being sold off, and copies still enquired for, a second edition
has been prepared for publication.&nbsp; In this edition the
Author has taken care to insert such additional information
respecting the places described in the former impression, as he
has been able to procure.&nbsp; A view of the Monastic Remains at
Tupholme, together with a short description of the place, is also
added; and for the drawing from which this view is engraved, the
Author has to acknowledge his obligation to Mr. Espin, of Louth,
who kindly furnished several of the former views.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the price of the book as much as possible,
the ancient and modern plans of Horncastle, together with the
Appendix, consisting chiefly of charters, which were included in
the first edition, in this are omitted.</p>

1</span>HORNCASTLE.</h2>
<h3>SITUATION.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Horncastle</span> is pleasantly situated
at the foot of that bold and even range of Hills, which, from
their openness, have been termed the wolds.&nbsp; It is nearly in
the centre of the Lindsey division of the county of Lincoln, and
is the chief of a soke of fifteen parishes to which it gives
name.</p>
<p>The principal part of the town is built within an angle formed
by the confluence of two rivers, the Bane and the Waring, where
an ancient fortification formerly stood, the scite of which is
still visible, denoting it in early times to have been a station
of importance.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The
character of the place however is now completely changed.&nbsp;
From a military station it has become a situation of trade; and
owing to its being surrounded by a considerable number of
villages, possesses one of the largest markets in the county.</p>
<p>Its distance from the city of Lincoln is twenty-one miles, and
eighteen from the town of Boston.</p>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>HORNCASTLE DURING THE ROMAN AND SAXON GOVERNMENTS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the invasion of Britain by
the Romans, whilst yet the island was divided into independent
states, the present scite of Horncastle with its immediate
neighbourhood was doubtless appropriated, like the rest of the
country of the Coritani, to the pasturing of herds and
flocks.&nbsp; In the formation of settlements no other
circumstances influenced the Britons than the conveniences which
might be afforded them in their accustomed occupations.&nbsp;
Vallies fertilized by streams, and the contiguous hills would
supply food for their cattle and sheep, whilst the neighbourhood
of forests invited to the pursuits of the chase.&nbsp; The rich
tracts of open grass land stretching along the banks of the river
Bane, and its tributary stream, would be populously occupied by
the pastoral inhabitants of this district.&nbsp; Hence it may be
presumed, that when the weak efforts of the Coritani for
independence had left them vanquished by the victorious arms of
the Romans, under Ostorius Scapula, and finally a tributary state
by the more efficient achievements of Suetonius Paulinus, this
portion of the country was soon secured by fixing on the present
scite of Horncastle a military station.&nbsp; From the almost
imperishable masses of the ancient wall which still remain, and
by the numerous coins, urns, and other vestiges of the Roman
people which have been found in this place, and are still met
with in turning up the soil, it evidently became in process of
time a station of considerable importance.&nbsp; It is difficult
however to make any definite suggestions as to the period at
which the fortifications were erected, no inscription having been
found to throw light upon the subject.</p>
<p>To secure by effectual barriers against insurrections, the
conquests which had already been made, whilst yet the bordering
people to the north, the fierce and powerful Brigantes, remained
unsubdued, might be deemed by the Romans a sufficient inducement
for raising frequent and effectual military works among the
inhabitants of this state: for it was not until Petillius
Cerealis was appointed by the emperor Vespasian to the command in
the province of Britain, that this hitherto <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>unbridled
nation were either conquered or involved in all the calamities of
warfare.&nbsp; Though there be no precise data by which the
decision may be guided, as to the time of the earlier military
erections which were formed at this place; yet it cannot be
ascribed to a much later period than the above occurrences so
intimately connected.&nbsp; At all events, it may not be
considered posterior to the effects which resulted from the wise
policy of Agricola.&nbsp; Immediately on his arrival to assume
the command, he placed along the frontiers of the several
subjugated districts, a chain of fortresses: these were
constructed with so much care and judgment, that the inhabitants
of those parts where the Roman arms had not then penetrated,
could never consider themselves secure from the vigor of the
conqueror. <a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a>&nbsp; The people, soon after this,
completed their submission to the yoke by yielding to the
allurements of Roman manners.&nbsp; Their ferocity was tamed:
from a savage people running wild in woods, they became
cultivated, acquiring knowledge, and dwelling in towns; and
finally sweetened their slavery, by indulging in the pleasures of
polished life.</p>
<p>From the circumstances of this station being situated on the
river Bane, several antiquaries have concurred in fixing here the
<span class="smcap">Banovallum</span> of the Roman geographer
Ravennas.&nbsp; This opinion has been the more readily adopted
from the etymology of the name; the latter part of the word being
Latin, and the whole collectively signifying a fortification on
the Bane.&nbsp; It is indeed probable that the Romans were
induced at first to make a station at this place, from its
convenient situation, easily rendered defensible by a
<i>vallum</i>, or temporary barrier, drawn across the aperture of
the two rivers from one bank to the other, and thence came its
designation.&nbsp; Afterwards they built the indissoluble stone
wall, whose vestiges after the lapse of ages are manifest nearly
the whole compass round. <a name="citation4b"></a><a
href="#footnote4b" class="citation">[4b]</a>&nbsp; It is to be
regretted that Ravennas gives no distances: he merely places
<span class="smcap">Banovallum</span> next after <span
class="smcap">Lindum</span>, so that nothing decidedly certain
can be gained from his work.</p>
<p>But, though it cannot be positively ascertained that this spot
was the Roman <span class="smcap">Banovallum</span>; yet, as the
name most evidently points out a fortification on the river Bane,
there appears little reason to question it; both from its
contiguity to the colony of <span class="smcap">Lindum</span>,
with which place <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>it had communication by means of a military road; as also
from its situation; particularly as no other remains of the
Romans have been discovered on that river, nor yet any near to
it, except some coins at the village of Ludford, where the Bane
has its source; and traces of an encampment at Tattershall, more
than a mile distant from its banks. <a name="citation5a"></a><a
href="#footnote5a" class="citation">[5a]</a></p>
<p>In what circumstances this station was involved from the final
subjugation of the Britons by Agricola, under whose paternal
government the province felt some portion of enjoyment in
cultivating the arts of peace, is not known: but, from the
evidence of antiquities, it is perceptible that it continued a
place of importance down to the period when the Romans in the
decline of their empire had withdrawn from Britain; though
probably, in the security of a long abstraction from war, its
military strength was somewhat disregarded.&nbsp; No sooner
however had the necessities and the mistaken policy of the
enervated inhabitants, again left to themselves, called to their
assistance the warlike Saxons, against the eruptions of the
northern barbarians, than we find this place agitated, in common
with the rest of the country, by all the calamities which were
connected with the desperate contests which ensued: the Britons
having to struggle for liberty, against the eagerness for
dominion on the part of the victorious Saxons.&nbsp; These
people, according to the practice which prevailed amongst them of
changing the names of Roman stations, gave to this place the
appellation of <span class="smcap">Hyrncastre</span> or <span
class="smcap">Hornecastre</span>, from its situation in an angle
formed by the junction of the two rivers, which denotes a
fortification in a corner, of which the present name <span
class="smcap">Horncastle</span> is evidently a corruption.</p>
<p>The Roman fortress was at that time either destroyed, or in a
very dilapidated state: for Horsa, the Saxon general and brother
of Hengist is stated to have enstrengthened the fortress of
Horncastle.&nbsp; This fortification however did not continue
long; for Horsa being defeated in an engagement with the Britons,
under the command of Raengeires, at the neighbouring village of
Tetford, Vortimer king of the Britons caused it to be beaten down
and rendered defenceless. <a name="citation5b"></a><a

<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>THE
MANOR.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the record called Domesday,
compiled towards the latter end of the reign of William the
Conqueror, it appears that the manor of Horncastle, previous to
the close of the Saxon Government, belonged to Editha the queen
of Edward the Confessor; but at the time of making that survey,
it formed, together with the soke, part of the possessions of the
king. <a name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a"
class="citation">[6a]</a></p>
<p>When the manor was separated from the crown does not appear;
but in the reign of Stephen it was the demesne of Alice or
Adelias de Cundi, who resided at her castle here, which leaves it
to be concluded that she held it by inheritance from her father.
<a name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>&nbsp; As she took part against the king
in his contention with the Empress Maud, he seized her lands, but
restored them again on condition that she should demolish her
castle, the means which had served to render her political
alliance formidable to his interest. <a name="citation6c"></a><a
href="#footnote6c" class="citation">[6c]</a>&nbsp; What may have
been the extent and nature of the structure possessed as the
mansion of Adclias is not now discoverable, no traces being to be
found; but its strength most probably consisted in a restoration
of the walls of the Roman fortress, which encircling some
convenient and less durable edifice, gave to the place of her
residence the security of a castle.</p>
<p>The restitution by Stephen of these lands to Adelias de Cundi,
seems to have been only for life, as her heir did not succeed
thereto; for this manor came again to the crown, and was
afterwards given by Henry the second to Gerbald le Escald, a
Fleming, who held it for one knight&rsquo;s fee, and who was
succeeded by his grandson or nephew and heir Gerrard de
Rhodes.&nbsp; <a name="citation6d"></a><a href="#footnote6d"
class="citation">[6d]</a>&nbsp; Gerrard was succeeded by his son
and heir Ralph de Rhodes, who, in the reign of Henry the third,
sold the manor to <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Walter Mauclerke, the third Bishop of Carlisle, who also
held the office of Treasurer of the Exchequer.&nbsp; This sale
being made in the spirit of these times when the feodal system
prevailed, the bishop and his successors were to hold the estate
by the performance of suit and service to Ralph de Rhodes and his
heirs.&nbsp; In the fourteenth year of the same reign, the
transfer to Walter Mauclerke was confirmed by the king, who in
the same year also granted to him three several charters,
conferring those immunities upon the manor and soke, which served
to raise the town of Horncastle from the dependence of a village,
to become in some degree the mart of the surrounding country.</p>
<p>The first of these charters gave to the bishop free warren
over the manor and the soke: the second the liberty of holding an
annual fair at this place, which was to commence two days before
the eve of the feast of St. Barnabas, and to continue eight days:
the third had for its objects the empowering of the bishop to try
felons, and to hold a court leet; also the exemption of the
inhabitants of the manor and the soke from toll, and several
other payments and services, beside protecting them from arrest
by the officers of the king and the sheriff. <a
name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a>&nbsp; An additional charter was granted
in the following year enabling the bishop to hold a weekly market
here every Wednesday; and also another annual fair to commence on
the eve of the feast of St. Lawrence, and to continue seven days.
<a name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; The custom of holding a fair on
the anniversary of this festival appears to have prevailed at an
earlier period, it being alluded to in the charter granting the
former fair.</p>
<p>In the same reign, Gerrard, the son and heir of Ralph de
Rhodes, appears to have preferred his claim to this manor, which
had been sold by his father; perhaps in consequence of some
omission in the performance of those services by which the estate
was to be held. <a name="citation7c"></a><a href="#footnote7c"
class="citation">[7c]</a>&nbsp; His claim does not appear to have
been successful; for in the seventeenth year of the same king,
the bishop fined to hold the manor in fee, but not to alienate
without licence.&nbsp; <a name="citation7d"></a><a
href="#footnote7d" class="citation">[7d]</a></p>
<p>Walter Mauclerke resigned the see of Carlisle in 1246, and as
the manor devolved to his ecclesiastical successors, it may be
inferred that it had been purchased to increase the revenues of
the bishoprick, and <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>not to be appropriated as his private property.&nbsp; The
privileges of such essential interest to the estate, which had
already been conferred by the preceding charters, were in part
strengthened by fresh acknowledgments to the Bishops of Carlisle,
in the reigns of the two succeeding kings; Edward the first
confirming the grant of free warren, and Edward the second that
which exempts the inhabitants of the manor and soke from certain
payments and services. <a name="citation8a"></a><a
href="#footnote8a" class="citation">[8a]</a></p>
<p>At the period of Richard the second, Roger le Scrop and
Margaret his wife, with Robert Tibetot and Eve his wife, heirs
and descendants of Gerbald le Escald, appear to have advanced a
claim to this manor, and to have succeeded in obtaining letters
patent, confirming to them homage and service from the
ecclesiastical possessor. <a name="citation8b"></a><a
href="#footnote8b" class="citation">[8b]</a>&nbsp; At that time
also when the border contests had laid waste the see of Carlisle,
and divested the bishops of their seat of Rose Castle in
Cumberland, they were necessitated to take up their residence at
Horncastle, which continued for some time to be their principal
place of abode.</p>
<p>In the twenty-fifth year of Henry the sixth, that monarch
confirmed the several charters granted to the bishops as lords of
this manor, by Henry the third, and also conferred on them
numerous other privileges. <a name="citation8c"></a><a
href="#footnote8c" class="citation">[8c]</a></p>
<p>The manor continued in the possession of the Bishops of
Carlisle, until the reign of Edward the sixth, when under the
authority of a licence from the crown, it was sold by Bishop
Aldrich to Edward Lord Clinton, who, during the time he held it,
compounded with the copyhold tenants, and enfranchised their
estates; but after Mary had ascended the throne, he was compelled
to re-convey his purchase to the see of Carlisle, to which, since
that time, it has continued to belong. <a
name="citation8d"></a><a href="#footnote8d"
class="citation">[8d]</a>&nbsp; Bishop Aldrich died at this place
in March, 1555, the second year of the reign of Queen Mary: from
which it appears, that the estate had either been restored
previous to his decease; or, in the conditions of the sale he had
reserved to himself the privilege of residing in the manor house.
<a name="citation8e"></a><a href="#footnote8e"
class="citation">[8e]</a></p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>In the
sixteenth year of the reign of Charles the second, the several
charters which had before been granted to the possessors of this
manor were again acknowledged, and the privileges further
extended. <a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a"
class="citation">[9a]</a></p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth had a lease of this manor from the then
possessing bishop, in which she was succeeded by James the first,
who assigned it to Sir Edward Clinton, knight; but owing to a
neglect of enrollment, it proved void. <a
name="citation9b"></a><a href="#footnote9b"
class="citation">[9b]</a>&nbsp; For nearly a century the lease
was held by the late Right Honorable Sir Joseph Banks, Baronet,
and his ancestors, and it is now held in trust for the benefit of
his devisees.</p>
<p>The large tract of fen land, situated between this place and
Boston, at a very early period belonged to the lords of this
manor, in conjunction with the lords of the manors of Bolingbroke
and Scrivelsby; but by the grants which they gave to the
neighbouring abbies at Revesby and Kirkstead, their right therein
became comparatively small. <a name="citation9c"></a><a
href="#footnote9c" class="citation">[9c]</a>&nbsp; On the
enclosure of these fens, pursuant to Act of Parliament, in 1801,
about six hundred acres were annexed to the parish of Horncastle,
eighty-one acres of which were allotted to the lord of the manor;
the remainder to the owners of common-right houses.</p>
<p>The parochial extent of Horncastle, exclusive of the fen
allotment, is about one thousand three hundred acres, two hundred
and fifty of which are contained in the manorial estates.</p>
<p>The house where the bishops used to reside, a spacious
structure, but destitute of architectural merit, was situated at
the north-west corner of the ancient fortress.&nbsp; It was
demolished about the year 1770, when the present manor house was
erected on its scite.</p>

10</span>HORNCASTLE DURING THE CIVIL WARS IN THE<br />
REIGN OF CHARLES THE FIRST.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Notwithstanding</span> that in this part
was born that individual of the family of Plantagenet, whose
assumption of the throne plunged the country, for half a century,
into the civil wars which nearly exterminated the ancient
nobility; yet had the soil here been unstained by the blood so
profusely shed.&nbsp; Partaking, in common with all, the miseries
of the land, it seemed peculiarly exempted from beholding those
contentions of the houses of York and Lancaster, which sprung
from the elevation of Henry of Bolingbroke to the sovereignty of
England.&nbsp; It was however otherwise when the usurpation of
unlimited power on the part of Charles the first had urged a war
between the people and the king.&nbsp; As peculiar circumstances
of policy and interest had brought the military operations into
these parts, it will be necessary in their detail to revert to
the conduct of the parties opposed in the opening of the war.</p>
<p>No sooner had the commons demanded concessions from the royal
prerogative, as the only security against the repeated
encroachments which had been made on the privileges of the
people, than they were impelled, by the insincerity of the
monarch, to protect the interest of the subject by every possible
means.&nbsp; The right of the sword was looked upon as the
exalted claim of the patriot alone; but as either party
considered themselves influenced by the sacred love of their
country, both made gradual advances to an appeal: the one to
protect the liberties of the people; the other, those general
interests which seemed connected with upholding the authority of
the king.&nbsp; As the commons were sensible that the monarch
would seize the first favorable opportunity to reinstate himself
in the former excess of his power, the earliest precautions were
taken in regard to the military establishments of the
country.&nbsp; Amongst these was secured the important fortress
of Hull, containing the arms of all the forces which had been
levied against the Scots: with these the parliament also assumed
to themselves the disposal of the militia, a force indeed
collected, but totally <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>untried in the conduct of war.&nbsp;
The king, on erecting his standard, opposed to this, as a
resource of strength, his Commission of Array.&nbsp; The call of
the monarch was obeyed by each county, as the political
inclinations of individuals led them, or in submission to the
influence and example of those men of fortune, with whose
interests that of their tenantry was intimately connected. <a
name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
<p>The contest carried on in the south and in the west with
vigor, already appeared favorable to the royal cause.&nbsp; In
the north, however, it sustained a decided check, by the strong
hold which the parliament possessed in the garrison of Hull, then
commanded by Lord Fairfax, who, unable to maintain the field
against the Marquis of Newcastle, had there retired, determined
to repel a siege with courage and ability; and to diminish the
strength of his enemy by sudden incursions.</p>
<p>The disposable forces of the parliament, not immediately
required for the defence of Hull, were too inconsiderable to
oppose the march into the south.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this, the
affairs of the king were ruined by confining the efforts of a
powerful army to investing this fortress; while the active enemy,
though few in number, acquired by their boldness and intrepidity,
an effective strength in the field.&nbsp; When Oliver Cromwell,
then beginning to signalize himself as the companion in arms of
the young and gallant Sir Thomas Fairfax, had by a signal victory
at Gainsborough, routed the royal troops; the Marquis of
Newcastle, beholding his brother Cavendish dead, amid the noblest
and bravest of his soldiers, seemed as if awakened by the calls
of vengeance to the necessity of more extensive exertions.&nbsp;
He therefore suddenly decided on harassing his opponents, while
weak and inefficient, by dispatching a competent force into the
heart of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Cromwell, though a conqueror, was
obliged to make a precipitate retreat; and as Lincoln was not
defensible, he hastened on the day succeeding his victory to
Boston; intending there, with the young Sir Thomas Fairfax, who
was proceeding with additional horse from Hull, to concentrate
their forces with those of the Earl of Manchester. <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a></p>
<p>The division of the royal army, destined for these parts, was
entrusted to the command of Sir John Henderson, an old and
valiant soldier, and to Sir William Widdrington, who was
appointed governor of Lincoln.&nbsp; As these leaders were
anxious to requite themselves for <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the defeat which had so recently
crowned the conquerors with the applause of heroism, they
determined to draw the enemy to an engagement before their
reinforcements should arrive: ere this however could be effected,
Manchester, upon advice of their intention, after possessing
himself of the strong fortress of Lynn, had advanced with the
disposable part of the army of the associated counties.&nbsp;
Such appeared to be the mutual disposition of affairs in the
north, at the beginning of October, 1643, in the first year of
the civil war.</p>
<p>The army of the parliament, about six thousand foot, and
thirty-seven troop of horse, being concentrated at Boston, it was
determined that companies should be distributed into such parts
as might secure their early co-operation whensoever occasion
should require.&nbsp; Bolingbroke, defended by a castle held by
the partizans of the king, called forth into exertion their vigor
and the alacrity of their courage. <a name="citation12"></a><a
href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a>&nbsp; This they
decided upon as the place of military operation; whilst as the
neighbourhood promised the most favorable circumstances for a
field, they would there invite the enemy on to battle.&nbsp;
Accordingly ten companies commanded by Major Knight, an officer
under Sir Miles Hobart, were disposed of at this place.&nbsp; A
regiment commanded by Colonel Russel, was quartered at Stickford,
about two miles distant; and three companies of the Earl of
Manchester&rsquo;s own at the village of Stickney.&nbsp; The
cavalry were all distributed into the country round, for about
eight or ten miles distance.</p>
<p>In the evening after their arrival, the castle of Bolingbroke
was summoned.&nbsp; The answer in effect was, that &ldquo;the
commander need not expect that the demands of arrogance alone
should win the castle.&rdquo;&nbsp; From this determined reply
promising a strenuous defence, dispositions were immediately
taken to acquire it by a regular siege.&nbsp; The church and a
neighbouring house were occupied by the assailants, earth works
were thrown up, and the assault commenced, but without much
effect.</p>
<p>During this time, the royalists, bold, eager, and trusting
that a generous heroism would nerve them for victory, waited only
the opportunity for attack.&nbsp; Upon learning the arrival of
the Earl of Manchester, they lost no time in drawing out all
their military from the several garrisons of Lincoln, Newark, and
Gainsborough, still <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>stimulated by an undaunted resolution to find out the
enemy, and advance to the combat.&nbsp; Hastening on, they
arrived, early on the day previous to the battle, at the
out-posts of the parliamentary forces.</p>
<p>No sooner had a detachment from the king&rsquo;s army,
advancing on the western road, been observed at Edlington,
reconnoitring the lines of their enemy, than word came to Sir
Thomas Fairfax, the commandant of the cavalry at Horncastle, that
a surprize was expected.&nbsp; Information was accordingly
dispatched to the Earl of Manchester: it found him at East Kirkby
hill, with Colonel Cromwell, and the Lord Willoughby of Parham,
intently observing the progress which the besiegers made against
the castle of Bolingbroke, and assiduously ordering the
dispositions of attack.&nbsp; Roused at this communication,
Cromwell immediately hurried to collect the troops dispersed
around.&nbsp; Fairfax was still every where distributing horsemen
for the purpose of enquiry, cautious to ascertain and forward
such accounts as might be obtained of the progress and number of
the royal forces; who though eager for battle, were careful to
deliberate on the promises of success.&nbsp; As the party who
caused the alarm, suspecting themselves seen, had drawn off with
such intelligence as they gathered, there seemed reason to
suppose that the main body of the royalists were yet at a
considerable distance: Fairfax therefore about sun set, learning
nothing additional, proceeded to the quarters at East Kirkby, to
confer on the measures proposed for the expected conflict.&nbsp;
In the mean time, the Earl of Manchester, with Lord Willoughby
and some other officers, had with the like object hastened to
Horncastle, previously appointing that at that place the forces
should be immediately collected; where, being drawn together, the
most effective resolutions might be taken for ensuring a victory,
or lessening the calamities of a defeat.</p>
<p>It was not until the dusk of the evening that the royal army,
under Sir John Henderson, moved rapidly on to the station of
their enemy.&nbsp; They had judged that the dubious light would
serve to conceal their true numbers; and that as nothing was
known of them with certainty, but their anxious readiness for the
encounter; so their opponents, whether few or many, deeming them
prepared for every casualty, might, by their indecision, leave an
easy conquest to their arms.</p>
<p>The out-posts were surprized by the precipitate advance of
these hostile forces; and in the unprepared circumstances of
those who maintained them, and the disparity of their numbers,
there was <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>afforded them no means of encountering their
difficulties, but the hardihood of a cool intrepidity.&nbsp; This
indeed was a stern calmness which always pervaded the breast of a
Puritan who was a soldier.&nbsp; He did not untremblingly bare
his bosom to the steel because, like a Roman, he abstractedly
considered fear inconsistent with the nobler qualities of human
nature; but because the factitious enthusiasm of his religion had
taught him to look with indifference on temporal things.&nbsp; If
the general good required the sacrifice of his life, the
particular calamities of his family were dismissed with scarce a
thought beyond a pious supplication.&nbsp; It was this feeling
which finally rendered the parliament victorious in the
contest.&nbsp; However in this unlooked-for state the soldiers at
the out-posts were exposed to much perplexity, and many were the
dangers recited amongst them on the morning of the gathering of
their strength for the field of battle.&nbsp; Some finding
themselves surrounded, out-numbered, and in all the perilous
circumstances of desperate warfare, were obliged to supply by
politic conduct the helplessness of their condition.&nbsp; These
therefore, hastily mounting their horses, agreed with much
resolution to break through the opposing ranks, sword in hand,
with the words of mutual encouragement, &ldquo;Come on! come on!
all is our own,&rdquo; thinking that the royalists, by these
ambiguous shouts, fearing an ambuscade, would leave to them an
easy passage by the sudden confusion of their alarm.&nbsp; In
this manner about four companies encountered two thousand
cavalry, with the loss of only three men.</p>
<p>Though these warriors, taking the advantage of the darkness of
the evening, were enabled by their resolute conduct to overcome
these difficulties; yet as the royal army had already advanced
onward to Horncastle, in strong and numerous detachments, they
were exposed in their retreat thither to fresh and obstinate
encounters.&nbsp; Perceiving, as they approached the town, that
they had come up to another party of the royalist&rsquo;s horse,
they determined, after saluting them as friends, to hurry onward
as if destined for some urgent duty.&nbsp; They had, however,
scarce passed them, when flushed with the success of their
stratagem, and feeling the pride and bravado of soldiers, who
deemed their individual preservation as of little value to their
common strength, if purchased without the blood of their enemy,
they turned to the attack of the unwary royalists.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For whom are ye?&rdquo; said they.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the
king.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are for the king and
parliament.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scarcely had these <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>declarations
been interchanged, when rushing precipitately on the unsuspecting
royalists and throwing them into disorder, the assailants fled
towards the town, deeming themselves secure in the quarters of
their comrades, and considering their valour rewarded in the
acclamations that would greet them from their friends.&nbsp; But
Horncastle, surprized at the approach of numerous hostile forces,
had been evacuated by the detachment of horse which possessed it;
and the inhabitants as soon as the town was seized by the troops
of the king, having secured the entrances and roads through it,
by forming barriers with carts and timber; the cavalry found
themselves again obliged to exert their unyielding valor in
turning upon their pursuers.&nbsp; Desperately therefore they
burst through them with the full energy of their courage,
sustaining the loss of some few men, among whom was a cornet; but
bringing away prisoners as the evidence of their perils and their
triumph. <a name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a></p>
<p>At this period of hurried confusion, and the setting in of the
night, the Earl of Manchester reached the town.&nbsp; He heard
the rejoicings of the troops, thus victorious in the dangers of
their retreat; taunting the royalists with their shouts, as they
drew off undefeated from their toils.&nbsp; Finding now that the
place designed for the assembling of his forces was already
possessed by the enemy, he hastily recalled the orders for the
general rendezvous at Horncastle, and appointed Bolingbroke in
its stead.&nbsp; Thither at night repaired the dispersed soldiery
of the parliament, except three or four troops of horse, who, in
the difficulties of retreating before superior forces, had been
obliged to proceed by the circuit of Tattershall, and did not
arrive until the next morning.</p>
<p>At Bolingbroke, Manchester designed to wait for the royalists;
but Cromwell, actuated by prudence, urged the delaying of the
battle, since the troops, upon whose prowess and exertion success
depended, were wearied, and little able to sustain the ardour of
the fight. <a name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a>&nbsp; The royal army were however too
eager to secure the promises of a victory, to permit their
adversaries to renew their strength by avoiding the
contest.&nbsp; As soon as the morning had dawned and the silence
of the surrounding country assured them that their enemies were
withdrawn from near them, and were assembling together at
Bolingbroke, they arrayed themselves for the encounter.&nbsp;
Before the middle of the day they <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>marched out, in strength about
seventy-five troops of horse, and five thousand foot, to meet the
soldiers of the parliament.&nbsp; Foreboding with certainty that
this would be their determination, Manchester was constrained to
the resolution of giving them battle, and immediately advanced
towards them.</p>
<p>The spot upon which the contending armies engaged was a gently
rising and broadly extended eminence, at a village called
Winceby, midway between Horncastle and Bolingbroke.&nbsp; It
commands an extensive prospect of the far stretched fen-lands of
the county; whilst to the westward is seen those cliffs, on the
summit of one of which magnificently rises the cathedral of
Lincoln.&nbsp; This the royal army had contemplated as a
district, which by victory was either to be restored to the
authority of the king; or by defeat to afford an effectual check
to the military operations in the north, and to be ensured as a
further resource to the parliament.&nbsp; The noon was already
passed when the armies came in sight of each other.&nbsp; The
royalists trusting with confidence to their mutual ardor,
rejoiced when they beheld the adverse soldiers advancing to meet
them, though amid the wild chant of hymns for mercy and for
victory.&nbsp; In the fields immediately before them they fixed
the order of their battle: formed into closely compacted lines,
the cavalry was placed in the advance, and covered the
infantry.&nbsp; The left wing of this array, was commanded by the
general Sir John Henderson. <a name="citation16a"></a><a
href="#footnote16a" class="citation">[16a]</a></p>
<p>The Earl of Manchester, pressed for ground in the marshalling
of his forces, presented alone his cavalry to the fight; the
infantry, headed by himself, being stationed so far in the rear
that they were unable to second the exertions of their horsemen.
<a name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a>&nbsp; The disadvantages arising from
fatigue, with the closeness of ground, and inequality of numbers,
were apparent to the warriors of the parliament.&nbsp; In the
doubtful promises of the contest, their leaders sought to
replenish their strength, and supply their situation by words and
by actions, infusing into them an energy and martial ardour
rivalling their own.&nbsp; Fairfax, who knew by experience that
the undaunted intrepidity of a few was more efficient in its
achievements than the impetuosity of those who <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>relied for
security on their numbers, pointed to his men the imposing array
of his adversaries, exclaiming &ldquo;Come let us fall on; I
never prospered better than when I fought with my enemies three
or four to one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cromwell, by the apparent bravery
with which he was animated, promised them that examples of
heroism should not be wanted, whilst life was given him to lead
them. <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, the commander of the royal forces did not
lose the opportunity which was afforded him of reminding his
fellow soldiers that vengeance was yet due for the defeat at
Gainsborough; and that now was supplied them a time to requite
themselves for the blood of the illustrious brother of
Newcastle.&nbsp; He set before them the necessity of strenuous
exertions and important sacrifices, by pointing to the example of
one, who exalted amidst the mighty of the land, lately fighting
among them, did not hesitate to devote himself to death for the
cause of his sovereign.&nbsp; At the moment therefore when the
armies were ready to engage, the royalists raised the cry of
&ldquo;Cavendish! on for Cavendish!&rdquo; which was as loudly
answered by the enthusiastic shout of &ldquo;Religion!&rdquo; the
zeal which animated those who proclaimed it, by inspiring them
with hopes of immortality, rendered death less to be dreaded than
the misfortunes of a defeat. <a name="citation17b"></a><a
href="#footnote17b" class="citation">[17b]</a></p>
<p>Scarce had the words of onset been given, when the divisions
of cavalry, under the command of Cromwell and Fairfax, were led
to the charge by Vermeydun, a soldier of valour, who headed the
first detachment as a forlorn hope, aspiring to the honor of
directing his comrades on to victory.&nbsp; Already the horsemen
of the royalists, with a well directed precision, had vigorously
poured into their ranks the second discharge of their fire
arms.&nbsp; These did some execution among them; and Cromwell
thus early had his horse shot under him.&nbsp; A minute had
elapsed before the parties fiercely met in the close encounter,
arm to arm.&nbsp; Cromwell for a time was compelled to grapple on
foot with his enemies, entangled amid the trappings of his dying
charger.&nbsp; Though felled to the ground as he attempted to
extricate himself from this perilous situation, he rose
uninjured.&nbsp; This singular man, bold and intrepid, animated
by zeal, foremost in the fight, struggling with disasters, seemed
peculiarly preserved in all his dangers to fill that situation in
the page of history, where, though elevated by violence, he <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>powerfully
commands our admiration by his success, his prudence, and the
daring of his genius.&nbsp; Sir Ingram Hopton, who at this moment
had attempted to seize him, was killed. <a
name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; Cromwell, now recovering a horse
from a soldier near him, bravely led on his companions to the
combat, strengthening their stern courage by the most signal
proofs of his personal bravery.</p>
<p>Not with less valor was the conflict sustained on the part of
the royalists.&nbsp; Sir John Henderson, the hardy veteran of
former battles, firm as a rock amid the rushing of the waves,
resisted every impetuous assault.&nbsp; His adversaries were
driven back in disorder; but these men, not readily to be
repulsed, returned, with a cool bravery and redoubled vigor to
the attack.&nbsp; For half an hour, firm and undecided, continued
the contest, sword against sword, and fortitude repelling
courage.&nbsp; The resolute warriors, who sustained the furious
charges of Fairfax and Cromwell, for the whole were not engaged,
relinquished not a portion of their ground.&nbsp; At last, a
division commanded by Sir William Saville wavering, though
reluctant to give way, became routed and completely
disordered.&nbsp; Yielding, they struck confusion into the other
bodies of their own horse; and these again were hurled with
precipitance upon the mass of their infantry.&nbsp; All being
alike borne down in this part of the field, none were left to
second the broken and disordered, in again advancing to the
combat.&nbsp; The division of Sir John Henderson and Lord Ething
alone maintained itself unyielding and unsubdued.&nbsp; The
exulting army of the parliament, now taking advantage of the
discomfiture of the other troops, and the tumult of the infantry,
assailed with a desperate charge the yet unrepulsed.&nbsp; In
vain did the royalist commander exhort his men to be resolute and
undismayed; but no prudence could uphold the advantages which
valor must lose.&nbsp; Their fortitude was giving way to despair;
and the successful, elated with the promises of victory, found no
equal disputants in men dismayed by the certainty of a
defeat.&nbsp; Perplexed amid the various and ineffectual efforts
of the other bodies of the royal troops, the disheartened
defenders of the field yielded beneath the shock of the adverse
weapons.&nbsp; The victorious soldiers now fiercely <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>plunging in
amidst the routed dragoons, many of whom at this time were on
foot and in the most appalling confusion, saw them quickly
disappearing beneath the havoc of their swords and the fury of
their horses.&nbsp; The infantry were for the most part
destroyed; for being intercepted by a body of cavalry, scarce a
man survived the carnage. <a name="citation19a"></a><a
href="#footnote19a" class="citation">[19a]</a>&nbsp; There was
now no safety but in a dishonorable flight.&nbsp; The pursuit
continued beyond Horncastle with unremitting fury; and along the
road were strewed the horse and the rider, the dead and the
dying. <a name="citation19b"></a><a href="#footnote19b"
class="citation">[19b]</a></p>
<p>The soldiers under the command of Manchester, who as yet had
partaken in no respect in the glory of the blood-shed, reserved
their efforts for securing the prisoners, and assisting the
scarce breathing wounded of the royal army, who were scattered
about the field in groups.&nbsp; Such partizans as had recently
been embodied by the commission of array, were pitiably
supplicating the mercy of their conquerors.&nbsp; Cursing with
deep execration that little regard which had hurried them to the
fight, without a feeling of interest in its issue, they cried out
that the commission of array had brought them thither against
their wills, and blessing the cause of liberty and religion,
added &ldquo;We die as true servants of the parliament as any in
England, and woe be to those who were the cause that Lincoln and
York became the prey of such a war.&rdquo; <a
name="citation19c"></a><a href="#footnote19c"
class="citation">[19c]</a></p>
<p>Though the battle was fought with determined obstinacy; yet,
whilst the parties maintained their ground, the loss was
comparatively small: the havoc that ensued was among the routed
and the flying.&nbsp; There were killed but few on the side of
the parliament.&nbsp; Those of rank who were slain of the royal
forces, were Sir George Bolles, and Sir Ingram Hopton.&nbsp; The
prisoners, about one thousand in number, were the wounded on the
field, and those parties of the dispersed fugitives, who to avoid
the overwhelming carnage of their pursuers, had secreted
themselves amongst the rugged and winding banks of a neighbouring
river: many indeed were taken whilst seeking refuge in the very
waters, where some had already perished, bleeding and wearied in
their armour, overcome in their inability to recover themselves
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>from the
deeper parts of the stream.&nbsp; The trophies which the
conquerors obtained in the fight of Winceby field, were arms for
fifteen hundred men, and thirty-five standards. <a
name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a></p>
<p>Returning from the pursuit, the exhausted cavalry rested for
the night in the villages around Horncastle.&nbsp; The infantry
occupied quarters in the town, where they found two hundred
horses left by their fugitive enemy.&nbsp; Of the wounded, the
Earl of Manchester ordered especial care to be taken, whilst the
dead were hastily consigned to the nearest graves.&nbsp; The body
of Sir Ingram Hopton was brought to Horncastle and buried in the
church: for Cromwell, who did not permit his political resentment
to render him callous or insensible to the generous feelings of a
soldier, experienced some sympathy for the individual whose ardor
in attempting his destruction, for what was deemed the welfare of
his country, had cost the sacrifice of his own life: he
therefore, upon his arrival in the town, commanded the
inhabitants to fetch the body of Sir Ingram Hopton, and inter it
with the honors due to his rank; observing, that though an enemy,
he was a gentleman and a soldier. <a name="citation20b"></a><a
href="#footnote20b" class="citation">[20b]</a></p>
<p>Of those royalists who escaped the slaughter, there were
scarce a thousand efficient for the field; and these were
destined to sustain another overthrow at the battle of Lincoln
close, which completed the warfare in this county.&nbsp;
Bolingbroke castle had already yielded; and this with
Tattershall, the principal places of defence in this
neighbourhood, were soon after devoted to the dismantling policy
of the parliament, which doomed them with the noble edifices of
the country, to that destruction which left them but ruins in
silent and lingering decay.</p>
<p>Although this victory afforded a cause for so much rejoicing
to the friends of the parliament; yet were its consequences
mightier for the interests which it strengthened, by the defeat,
on the same day, <a name="citation20c"></a><a href="#footnote20c"
class="citation">[20c]</a> of the Marquis of Newcastle before the
fortress of Hull.&nbsp; The Lord Fairfax and Sir John Meldrum,
making a desperate sortie, had completely overthrown the
royalists with much slaughter; forcing them, though <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>protected
behind strong entrenchments, to abandon the siege with the loss
of all their cannon.&nbsp; The impolicy of the royalist commander
was now perceptible too late.&nbsp; This ruin of the affairs of
the king seemed at once to have obliterated all the generous
services which the faithful Newcastle had made in the cause of
his sovereign; and shortly after these disasters, he retired to
the continent, <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a> where he spent a life of indigence,
until the restoration gave again the royal authority to
Britain.&nbsp; These actions, though inconsiderable in
themselves, were yet great in their effects.&nbsp; The
expectations of the royalists in Yorkshire were now nearly
blasted: Lincolnshire, after the occupation of its city, escaped
the further deluge of blood; and the defeats served to assist in
hastening the fight of Marston Moor, where the hopes of Charles
were reduced to that one gleam, which was finally extinguished at
the battle of Naseby.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the remains of antiquity at
this place, the vestiges of the Roman fortress are the most
worthy of attention; and although they are too small to give an
adequate idea of the original structure, are yet sufficient to
show the form and extent of the space enclosed, which appears to
have been nearly a parallelogram, of about six hundred feet in
length, and in breadth three hundred and fifty on the east, and
three hundred on the west. <a name="citation22"></a><a
href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp; The wall by
which this area was surrounded <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>was fifteen or sixteen feet in
thickness, and composed of small blocks of a loosely aggregated
sand stone, dug from the neighbouring hills.&nbsp; It was formed
with casing stones on the outside, the internal parts being
filled up with courses laid diagonally, which according to the
customary and substantial mode of building among the Romans, were
run together by mortar disseminated through the interstices in a
fluid state, forming a cement which has acquired by time an
imperishable induration.&nbsp; Of the casing stones none are now
to be seen, except in cellars which have been formed by the side
of the wall.&nbsp; Where the fragments are sufficiently high,
those portions of the Roman masonry, which remained after the
destruction of the fortress, may be perceived rising to about six
or seven feet above the ground, the diagonal courses of stone
then ceasing.&nbsp; Above this the construction is marked by
masses of larger dimensions than the lower parts; a circumstance
evincing that another structure of a different period has been
erected on the original foundation: this was probably a
reparation which was made in the time of the Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp;
At the north-east corner of the enclosure the remains of a
circular turret are still visible; but of the towers or gateways
no traces are left.</p>
<p>Near the junction of the two rivers, on the south-west of the
town, was formerly one of those mazes common to Roman stations,
called the Julian Bower.&nbsp; In these the youth were exercised
in a martial game, called Troy Town, which in after years, though
divested of its martial character, continued to be amongst the
healthy pastimes of the young, in their evening assemblies of
pleasure and sport. <a name="citation23"></a><a
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a>&nbsp; Cultivation
has long since effaced every vestige of the maze; but the piece
of land on which it stood still retains the name of the <i>Julian
Bower Close</i>.</p>
<p>A peculiar rustic ceremony, which used annually to be observed
at this place, doubtless derived its origin from the Floral games
of antiquity.&nbsp; On the morning of May-day, when the young of
the neighbourhood assembled to partake in the amusements which
ushered in <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>the festivals of the month of flowers, a train of youths
collected themselves at a place to this day called the May
Bank.&nbsp; From thence, with wands enwreathed with cowslips,
they walked in procession to the may-pole, situated at the west
end of the town, and adorned on that morning with every variety
in the gifts of Flora.&nbsp; Here, uniting in the wild joy of
young enthusiasm, they struck together their wands, and
scattering around the cowslips, testified their thankfulness for
that bounty, which widely diffusing its riches, enabled them to
return home rejoicing at the promises of the opening year.&nbsp;
That innovation in the manners and customs of the country, which
has swept away the ancient pastimes of rustic simplicity,
obliterated about the year 1780 this peculiar vestige of the
Roman Floralia.</p>
<p>In the fields on the south side of the town, the ground
abounds with fragments of cinerary urns, and several perfect ones
have also there been discovered.&nbsp; From these circumstances,
together with the appearance of the soil, it seems certain that
in this part the Romans used to burn their dead on the funeral
pile.&nbsp; Of the urns found, only two are known to exist in the
neighbourhood; one being in the collection of the late Right
Honorable Sir Joseph Banks, at Revesby Abbey, the other in the
possession of Mr. Crowder, an inhabitant of the town.</p>
<p>It is much to be regretted for the advancement of researches
into local antiquities that the chief part of the urns, coins,
fibul&aelig;, and other Roman vestiges discovered at Horncastle,
have been sold to strangers who have visited the town, or to
dealers elsewhere.&nbsp; The coins which have been found here are
numerous, and though chiefly of small brass and denarii
&aelig;rei of the lower empire, yet they include many extremely
fine and varied specimens of the earlier imperial coins, both of
a larger size and of other metals, several of which are in the
possession of different individuals of the town.&nbsp; Amongst
these may be particularized the silver coins of Vespasian, L.
Septimius Severus, Alexander Severus, and Volusianus; the large
brass of Trajan; and the middle brass of Caligula, Claudius,
Nero, Trajan, Hadrian, Domitian, Antoninus Pius, Faustina the
elder, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and Faustina the younger.&nbsp;
The small brass and denarii &aelig;rei form nearly a complete
series of the emperors from Gallienus to Valentinianus the
second, and include also within that period, coins of some of the
tyrants of Britain and Gaul.&nbsp; Beside these are some others
in the collection of <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the late Reverend Charles
L&rsquo;Oste, now possessed by his son, but unfortunately no
memoranda exist by which they are to be distinguished from those
obtained at other places.&nbsp; This gentleman also had in his
collection several fibul&aelig; and stiles which had been
discovered here.</p>
<p>A British coin found at this place has on its concave side the
horse and symbolic circles; on the convex is the representation
of an animal apparently intended for a stag, with similar
ornaments around it, to those the other side possesses.&nbsp;
Many of the early English silver currency have been found here,
and also a specimen of the Scottish coinage of David the
second.</p>
<p>In deepening the bed of the river Bane, to complete the
navigation, in 1802, an ornamental brass spur, part of a brass
crucifix, and a dagger, were found together at a short distance
from the north bason of the navigation.&nbsp; The spur is now
lost; the part of the crucifix and the dagger are in the
possession of the author.</p>

there was not one erected when that survey was made; there
however appears to have been one in the reign of Richard the

</a></p>
<p>The present structure, which is dedicated to Saint Mary,
stands in the centre of the town, and possesses but few
attractions for the antiquary or the architect.&nbsp; It consists
of a square tower, a nave and chancel, with north and south
aisles.&nbsp; Being for the most part built with the soft and
imperfectly aggregated sand-stone of the neighbourhood, which
yields easily to the moisture of the atmosphere, it has suffered
much from the effects of time; and the decayed parts being
repaired with brick, gives to the building a motley and
unprepossessing appearance.</p>
<p>The few portions of the original architecture which have
escaped the silent ravages of years and the hands of the
innovator, bespeak the building of no higher antiquity than the
period of Henry the seventh.&nbsp; The aisle on the north side of
the chancel is ornamented with embattlements, on which
quatrefoils and blank shields are sculptured.&nbsp; It was
probably used as a chantry, one of the windows having formerly
contained an inscription justifying such a supposition. <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a>&nbsp; This aisle does not extend the
whole length of the chancel, and in the space so left, the
remains of an oratory and confessional are still visible; this
space formerly appropriated as a depository for coals to
distribute among the poor, is now occupied by a building to
contain the fire engines; a corresponding part of the south aisle
being used as a vestry.&nbsp; The aisle on the south side of the
chancel was rebuilt in 1820; but the original windows were
restored and again inserted.&nbsp; Part of the aisle on the south
of the nave was rebuilt in the following year.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>The
interior of the church is remarkably neat and well pewed.&nbsp; A
gallery at the west end of the nave contains an organ which was
purchased by subscription in 1810.&nbsp; Galleries are also
erected in each aisle of the nave.</p>
<p>In the wall of the north aisle is a stone, containing the
figure in brass of Sir Lionel Dymoke, in armour, kneeling on a
cushion, and holding in his hand a label, on which is written, in
black letter,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Sc&rsquo;ta
trinitas unus deus miserere nob.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On each side of him are two shields containing arms, at one of
the lower corners are the figures of his two sons, and at the
other those of his three daughters, and under him this
inscription in black letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In honore sc&rsquo;te et individue

<h3>THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Grammar School is situated at
the south-east corner of the church yard, and is a spacious and
well-constructed edifice of brick.&nbsp; It was founded and
endowed by Edward Lord Clinton and Saye, the Lord High Admiral of
England, under the authority of letters patent, dated the 25th of
June, 1652.&nbsp; By these letters it was ordained, that this
institution should be denominated &ldquo;The Free Grammar School
of Queen Elizabeth, in the Town or Soke of Horncastle, of the
foundation of Edward Lord Clinton and Saye,&rdquo; for the
education, training, and instruction of boys and youths in
grammar, and to be appropriated to this object for ever.</p>
<p>The school was to be conducted by a master, and a sub-master,
or usher: ten governors were also appointed and incorporated,
with perpetual succession, and a common seal.&nbsp; These
governors were empowered on the death of any of their body, to
elect others in their places; also to nominate the master and
usher on any vacancy; and to make such statutes concerning the
preservation and disposal of the revenues, as circumstances at
any time might dictate.&nbsp; Besides holding the endowments,
they were authorized to purchase and receive lands and other
possessions, not exceeding &pound;40. per annum.</p>
<p>The estates by which the establishment is maintained, consist
of houses and land situated at Horncastle, Hemingby, Sutton,
Huttoft, <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>and Winthorpe.&nbsp; The lands in the last three named
parishes being subject to inundations from the sea, the annual
revenue is rendered precarious; but in the more favorable years
it amounts to about &pound;200.</p>
<p>The salaries for a long time were &pound;40. per annum to the
master, and &pound;30. to the sub-master or usher: but on the
appointment of the present master, in 1818, the salary was
advanced to &pound;80. per annum, to which was also added a house
for his residence; the salary of the sub-master remaining as
heretofore, at &pound;30.&nbsp; The sum of &pound;2. 2<i>s.</i>
per annum is charged for those scholars who are instructed in
writing and arithmetic.&nbsp; There are at this period about
twenty boys on the foundation.</p>
<p>The governors of this School have also the management of
another school in the town, for the instruction of poor children
in reading, sewing, and knitting.&nbsp; A house, with a salary to
the teacher of &pound;17. per annum, charged upon certain estates
in Horncastle, having been bequeathed to them in trust, for that
purpose, by Mr. Richard Watson, a native of this place, who died
in 1784.</p>

<h3>THE RIVER BANE AND NAVIGABLE CANAL.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> river Bane, rising at the
village of Ludford, takes its course in a direction nearly south
to join its waters with those of the Witham.&nbsp; After
meandering through an extent of country about fourteen miles, it
receives at Horncastle, the tributary stream of the Waring, and
abundantly supplies the town, conveniently situated at the
confluence of the two rivers.&nbsp; From hence continuing a
gently winding course, it washes Tattershall and its moorlands,
before it falls into the larger river to increase its waters to
the sea.</p>
<p>In the year 1792, an act of parliament was obtained for making
the Bane navigable from the river Witham, through Tattershall to
Horncastle. <a name="citation35"></a><a href="#footnote35"
class="citation">[35]</a>&nbsp; The act, after reciting the names
of the original subscribers, incorporates them by the name of
&ldquo;The Company of Proprietors of the Horncastle Navigation in
the County of Lincoln,&rdquo; giving them perpetual succession
and a common seal, and empowering them to raise &pound;15,000. in
three hundred shares of &pound;50. each.&nbsp; The interest of
these was not to exceed &pound;8. per cent.&nbsp; No person was
to be the <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>possessor of less than one share, nor to hold more than
twenty.&nbsp; As circumstances might require, they were
authorized to raise &pound;1,000. more, by shares or mortgages of
the tolls.</p>
<p>The tollage allowed by this act was, for goods passing the
whole length of the navigation, 2<i>s.</i> per ton; from the
Witham to the seventh lock, 1<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> per ton; and
from the Witham to the fourth lock, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per
ton; excepting lime, lime-stone, manure, or materials for roads,
for which, only half the already mentioned tolls were to be
taken.</p>
<p>The works were commenced in the year 1793; but, when about two
thirds were completed, the whole of the funds to be appropriated
to their execution were already expended.&nbsp; After suffering
the canal to remain several years in this unfinished state, the
company applied again to Parliament, and in the year 1800 another
act was obtained, enabling them to raise &pound;20,000. more by
subscription amongst themselves, by admission of new subscribers
in shares of &pound;50. each, by mortgage, or by granting
annuities.&nbsp; The limitation of shares and interest were
repealed by this act; and the tonnage rates advanced to
3<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per ton for the whole length of the
navigation, 2<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> to the seventh lock, and
1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to the fourth; lime, lime-stone, manure,
and materials for roads excepted as before from the payment of
full rates.</p>
<p>Shortly after the works were recommenced, the plan of
completing them by an entirely new canal was adopted in
preference to that which they had before pursued of rendering the
Bane navigable.&nbsp; It was therefore at the village of Dalderby
diverted from the course of the natural stream, and carried on in
a less varied track to the point of junction between the waters
of the Bane and Waring: from hence it was continued in the
divergent courses of these two rivers, to the more extreme parts
of the town of Horncastle.&nbsp; It was completed in September,
1802, and on Friday the seventeenth of that month the vessels
entered the town.&nbsp; The canal is sufficiently deep to
navigate vessels of fifty tons burthen.</p>
<p>From this town to the river Witham the distance is about
eleven miles, in which the stream has a fall of eighty-four
feet.</p>
<h3><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>THE
PRESENT STATE OF THE TOWN, FAIRS, MARKETS, &amp;c.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> this place was favored at
an early period with a charter for a market, which in the time of
Henry the eighth appears to have been well frequented, yet it
remained for many years little more than a considerable village.
<a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a>&nbsp; From the earliest accounts it
seems to have been gradually encreasing; but it was not until
later years, when a new impulse was given to the agricultural
interests of the country, that it began to exhibit material
evidences of extention and improvement.</p>
<p>From a plan of the town drawn by Dr. Stukeley, in the year
1722, it appears at that period of time, now the lapse of a
century, to have been little more than half its present
extent.&nbsp; This plan, not having been made from actual survey,
cannot be considered as an accurate representation: nevertheless
it is calculated to give a tolerable idea of the state of the
town at the time it was executed.&nbsp; It is traditionally
asserted that at that period scarcely a brick house was to be
found in the parish; the early erected dwellings being all
constructed with clay walls and covered with thatch; thus
evidencing that common character which Leland the antiquary
assigns to the towns of this part.&nbsp; The clay buildings have
for the most part disappeared, and brick structures are now
erected in their stead; and from the spirit of improvement which
has lately been evinced, they will doubtless in a few years be
entirely removed.&nbsp; The rebuilding of many houses in the
principal streets in a handsome manner, within the last twenty
years, has given to the town an air of respectability; but the
effect which <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>would be produced by these buildings in its general
appearance, is materially diminished by the narrowness and
irregularity of the streets.&nbsp; At this time the number of
houses may be computed at about seven hundred, and of
inhabitants, about three thousand five hundred.</p>
<p>The entrances to the town, as well as its general aspect, have
also been improved by the inclosure of the fields by which it is
surrounded.&nbsp; To accomplish this an act of parliament was
obtained in 1803, and carried into effect the following year.</p>
<p>In no respect has the town changed more than in its trade; a
large proportion of its inhabitants having formerly been employed
in the tanning of leather, in which manufacture the yards on the
south side of the Far-street were almost exclusively
occupied.&nbsp; About fifty years ago the number of these
establishments began rapidly to decline, and are at this time
reduced to two.&nbsp; Since the completion of the canal in 1801,
a considerable trade in corn and wool has been carried on here;
about thirty thousand quarters of the former, and three thousand
sheets of the latter being annually sent from this place.&nbsp;
The town also from its situation in a well inhabited district
enjoys a large retail trade.</p>
<p>There are now three fairs for horses, cattle and sheep, held
here annually.&nbsp; The first, which concludes on the
twenty-second of June, has of late years declined very much, and
though chartered for eight days seldom continues more than
three.&nbsp; The second, which terminates on the twenty-first of
August, has long been celebrated as the largest fair for horses
in the kingdom, perhaps it may be said in the world; it continues
about ten days, being three days more than the time expressed in
the charter.&nbsp; To this fair are brought for sale horses of
all descriptions from every part of the kingdom, to the number of
many thousands; and beside the most extensive dealers of this
country, there are to be found in the fair purchasers and dealers
from different parts of the continent of Europe, and even from
America.&nbsp; The third fair, which is held on the twenty-eight
and twenty-ninth days of October, was removed to this place in
1768, from Market-Stainton, a decayed market town, about eight
miles distant, two hundred pounds being given to the lord of the
manor of that place, to permit the removal, one half of this sum
was raised by subscription amongst the inhabitants of this town,
the other by William Banks, Esquire, the then lessee of the
manor.&nbsp; The market is now held every Saturday, <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>to which it
was changed from Wednesday, the day mentioned in the charter,
probably in consequence of the markets at Boston and Louth being
also on that day; but the time at which the alteration took place
cannot now be ascertained.</p>
<p>On the south side of the church-yard is a building
appropriated for the purposes of a Dispensary, which is supported
by public subscription.&nbsp; Those to whom medical aid is
administered are such of the sick poor, in the town and
neighbourhood of Horncastle, as are recommended by subscribers;
and the many to whom assistance has been afforded, evince its
utility in a striking degree.&nbsp; The Dispensary is attended
every Tuesday and Saturday morning by a physician, whose service
is gratuitous, and by an apothecary who receives a salary.&nbsp;
These gentlemen visit such patients as are unable to attend at
the Dispensary.&nbsp; A female accoucheur also belongs to the
establishment.&nbsp; The number of patients admitted from the
commencement of the institution in September 1789, to September
1821, was 9389.</p>
<p>In the year 1790 a Literary Society was established in this
town, and which since its commencement has occupied a room at the
Dispensary as a library.&nbsp; The property of this society is
permanent and unalienable; excepting that books considered
unworthy of being preserved are disposed of at the next
anniversary but one after their purchase.&nbsp; The library
contains about eleven hundred volumes, and is open to the members
two days in the week.&nbsp; For several years the subscription
was only ten shillings and sixpence per annum; it was afterwards
advanced to fourteen shillings, and subsequently to one
pound.&nbsp; Subscribers are now also required to pay one pound
on their admission.&nbsp; The society at present consists of
about forty members.</p>
<p>In the year 1807 the inhabitants of this town in conjunction
with several other towns and villages, in the county of Lincoln,
made application to parliament, and obtained an act for the
recovery of debts not exceeding the sum of five pounds.&nbsp; The
commissioners hold their courts at this place every fourth
Thursday.</p>
<p>The education of the poor which has lately excited so much
attention in various parts of the kingdom, has not been neglected
here.&nbsp; A school on the Lancasterian or British system was
established at a public meeting held in October, 1813; and but a
few days subsequently a meeting was held at the church, when it
was resolved to establish also a school on the plan of Dr.
Bell.&nbsp; Early in the ensuing <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>year, buildings were erected, and
each system began to be acted upon.&nbsp; Both schools are
supported by voluntary contributions, and each contains about two
hundred children.</p>
<p>Beside the established church, there are in this town a
society of Wesleyan Methodists; a small congregation of
Calvinistic Baptists; a society of Primitive Methodists, or
ranters; and a congregation of Independents.</p>
<h2><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>THE
SOKE OF HORNCASTLE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of compiling the
Domesday record, there appears to have been included other
parishes, in addition to those now comprised in this soke; but it
cannot now be ascertained at what time the alteration took place.
<a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; Beside the parish of Horncastle
it at present contains the following townships:&mdash;Thimbleby,
West Ashby, Low Tointon, High Tointon, Mareham on the Hill,
Roughton, Haltham, Wood Enderby, Moorby, Wilksby, Mareham le Fen,
and Coningsby.&nbsp; To these have lately been added Langriville
and Thornton le Fen, portions of the fen district, which had been
sold by the commissioners appointed under an act of enclosure,
and rendered parochial by act of parliament in 1812.&nbsp; On the
enclosure of these fens, under the act which was obtained in
1801, the whole of the parishes in this soke, excepting the two
newly formed ones, had portions of land allotted to them, in lieu
of their right of common.</p>
<p>West Ashby, High Tointon, Mareham on the Hill, and Wood
Enderby, were formerly hamlets of the parish of Horncastle; but
have for several years been considered as distinct parishes, and
have appointed their own churchwardens and overseers of the
poor.</p>
<h3>THIMBLEBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Book Stimelbi, and in old writings Thimelby, is
about a mile north-west from Horncastle, the parishes adjoining
each other.&nbsp; The manor which in the reign of Charles the
second was the property of Sir Robert Bolles of Scampton, is now
possessed by Thomas Hotchkin, Esquire, of Tixover, in the county
of Rutland, in the possession of whose ancestors it has been for
many years.&nbsp; In this parish is also the manor of Hallgarth,
which formerly belonged to a family named Bolton; but is now the
joint property of Richard <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Elmhirst, Esquire, of Uzzleby, and
Mr. Kemp of Thimbleby.&nbsp; The church rebuilt in the year 1744,
is a small stone edifice, possessing a considerable share of
architectural merit: a stone over the door points out the year in
which it was rebuilt, but besides this it exhibits no other
inscription. <a name="citation42a"></a><a href="#footnote42a"
class="citation">[42a]</a>&nbsp; The advowson of the rectory
belongs to the lord of the manor.</p>
<h3>WEST ASHBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday called Aschebi, and in old writings Askeby, is a
parish adjoining to the north boundaries of that of Horncastle,
from which town the village is about two miles distant.&nbsp; In
this parish is the manor of Ashby Thorpe, now belonging to the
devisees of the late Mr. Joseph Rinder; but the possessor of that
of Horncastle claims manorial rights over the other parts of the
parish.&nbsp; Previous to the dissolution of monasteries in the
reign of Henry the eighth, the abbey of Kirkstead had a grange in
this parish, which, in the fifth year of Edward the sixth, was
granted amongst other estates to William Cecil Lord Burghley,
Lord High Treasurer of England; and now forms part of the Ashby
Thorpe estate.&nbsp; The church consists of a tower, a nave with
a north aisle, and a chancel. <a name="citation42b"></a><a
href="#footnote42b" class="citation">[42b]</a>&nbsp; The benefice
is a curacy, in the presentation of the Bishop of Carlisle.</p>
<h3>LOW TOINTON,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Todingtune, and in old writings Nether Tointon, is
about a mile eastward from the town of Horncastle, the parishes
adjoining.&nbsp; <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>The manorial estates, which comprise nearly the whole
parish, are the property of Lancelot Rolleston, Esquire, of
Watnall, in the county of Nottingham, by whose ancestors it has
been possessed for several generations.&nbsp; The church, which
is a small modern erection, being rebuilt in 1811, contains a
very curiously sculptured font, and the following inscription on
a plate of copper in the north wall:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Heare lyeth the Body of EDWARD ROLLESTON
Esquir who departed this Life the twenty-third of July in the
thirtey-fourth year of his age interr&rsquo;d underneath this
place the fourth of August Anno Domini 1687.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The patrons of the rectory are Lord Gwydir, and the Baroness
Willoughby of Eresby, his mother.</p>
<h3>HIGH TOINTON,</h3>
<p>In old writings Over Tointon, is about a mile and a half
eastward from Horncastle, to which parish and also that of Low
Tointon it adjoins.&nbsp; From only one place of this name being
mentioned in the Domesday record, it is probable that at the time
of making that survey both High and Low Tointon were included in
one parish.&nbsp; The manorial estates, which have descended with
those of Horncastle, belong to the Bishop of Carlisle, and are
leased to different individuals.&nbsp; The church is a small
uninteresting building.&nbsp; The Bishop of Carlisle is patron of
the curacy.</p>
<h3>MAREHAM ON THE HILL,</h3>
<p>Anciently written Maringe and Mayring, is about a mile and a
half south-east from Horncastle, the parishes adjoining each
other.&nbsp; The manor once belonged to Edward Marsh, Esquire, of
Hundle House, in the county of Lincoln, by a descendant of whom
it was sold to William Hudson, Esquire, of Gray&rsquo;s
Inn.&nbsp; In 1659 it was sold to a person named Duncombe, of
whom it was purchased, in 1688, by Sir Edmund Turnor, of Stoke
Rochford, Knight, and is now possessed by his descendant of the
same names. <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a>&nbsp; The chapel is completely
destitute of interest.&nbsp; On repairing it, about fifteen years
ago, two nobles of Edward the fourth, two angels of Henry the
seventh, and several silver coins of different reigns, contained
in a leathern purse, were discovered concealed in the wall.&nbsp;
The patron of the curacy is the Bishop of Carlisle.</p>
<h3><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>ROUGHTON,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Rocstune, and in old writings Ructon, is about
four miles from Horncastle.&nbsp; The manorial estates belong to
Lady Banks.&nbsp; The church, which is a small building,
consisting of a tower, nave and chancel, contains a marble
tablet, on which is the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies the Body of NORREYS FYNES, Esq.
Grandson to Sir Henry Clinton, commonly called Fynes, eldest Son
of Henry Earl of Lincoln, by his Second Wife, Daughter of Sir
Richard Morrison, and Mother of Francis Lord Norreys, afterwards
Earl of Berkshire.&nbsp; He had by his much beloved and only Wife
Elizabeth, who lies by him, Twelve Children, of which Four Sons
and Two Daughters were living at his decease, which happened on
the 10th of January 1735&ndash;6 in the 75th year of his
age.&nbsp; From the Revolution he always liv&rsquo;d a Nonjuror,
which rendered him incapable of any other Publick Employment
(tho&rsquo; by his Great Abilitys and Known Courage equal to the
most Difficult and Dangerous) than that of being Steward to two
great Familys, wherein he distinguish&rsquo;d himself during his
Service of 40 years a most Faithful and Prudent Manager, of a
most Virtuous and Religious Life.&nbsp; His paternal Estate he
left without any addition to his Son <span
class="smcap">Kendal</span> his next heir.&nbsp; His eldest Son
<span class="smcap">Charles</span> was buried here the 26th of
August 1722, aged 36 years, whose Pleasant Disposition
adorn&rsquo;d by many virtues which he acquir&rsquo;d by his
Studys in Oxford made his death much lamented by all his
Acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There also occur two other tablets; one to the memory of the
Rev. Arthur Rockcliffe, who died in 1798, aged 71; the other to
the memory of Charles Pilkington, Esq. who died in 1798, aged 75,
and of Abigail his wife, who died in 1817, aged 80. <a

Haltham in 1741, is in the presentation of the Honorable and
Reverend Champion Dymoke.</p>
<h3>HALTHAM,</h3>
<p>Called in the Domesday survey Holtham, is about five miles
distant <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>from Horncastle.&nbsp; The manorial estates, which
comprise almost the whole of the parish, once belonged to the
Marmyons of Scrivelsby, and are now possessed by the Champion
Dymoke, a descendant of the female branch of that family.&nbsp;
The church, which appears to have suffered much from time, has in
its pristine state possessed a considerable share of
architectural merit.&nbsp; A large window at the eastern end
contains very fine tracery, and at one time, together with some
of the other windows, exhibited a large portion of stained glass,
of which only one piece, containing the arms of La Wane, is now
remaining. <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"

<p>In the Domesday record written Endrebi, is about five miles
distant from Horncastle.&nbsp; The manor is the property of Lady
Banks.&nbsp; The church is a small uninteresting building.&nbsp;
The Bishop of Carlisle is patron of the curacy.</p>
<h3>MOORBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Morebi, is about five miles distant from
Horncastle.&nbsp; The manorial estates, comprising the principal
part of the parish, are the property of Lady Banks.&nbsp; The
church is totally destitute of interest.&nbsp; The Bishop of
Carlisle is patron of the rectory.</p>
<h3>WILKSBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Wilchesbi, is about six miles distant from
Horncastle.&nbsp; The manor is the property of Lady Banks.&nbsp;
The church is a small modern erection.&nbsp; The Champion Dymoke
is patron of the rectory.</p>
<h3>MAREHAM LE FEN,</h3>
<p>In the Domesday book called Marun, and in old writings Marum,
is about seven miles distant from Horncastle, and situated on the
verge of the recently enclosed fenny district, from whence it has
received its appellation.&nbsp; The manor is the property of Lady
Banks; it having been purchased, together with the three before
mentioned manors, by an ancestor of the late Sir Joseph Banks,
above a century ago.&nbsp; The manor house, which has for several
years been occupied by Mr. James Roberts, possesses from its
adjoining gardens, a considerable share of interest.&nbsp; Having
accompanied Sir Joseph Banks, in the first voyage of Captain Cook
round the world, Mr. Roberts has sought to associate with the
rural simplicities of an English garden, such objects of
curiosity as a pleasurable recollection of those scenes had
furnished.&nbsp; In addition to numerous rustic and ornamental
seats, the gardens are embellished with huts resembling those of
Terra del Fuego and New Holland; and also a small museum of
curiosites, principally from the South Sea islands.&nbsp; A visit
to this spot is always an agreeable recreation.&nbsp; The
following lines were written after a visit here, by a native of
Jamaica.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear is the rural scene that
Fancy loves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where tuneful Rapture chants th&rsquo;
enliv&rsquo;ning song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In wildest warblings to the darkling groves,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pouring in wildest mood the strains along;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While Echo, from the leafy bowers among,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives a soft cadence to the songster&rsquo;s
tale,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A mingled sweetness to the warbling throng,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That comes in whispers on the balmy gale.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These, Mareham, with thy spreading greenwood
shade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy silent waters, and thy mossy cell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Breathe such a charm, that oft Delight has
strayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With ling&rsquo;ring steps, &rsquo;mid scenes she
lov&rsquo;d so well;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And when fond Mem&rsquo;ry shall thy joys renew,<br
/>
She&rsquo;ll tell with musing voice her sweet, her last
adieu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The church consists of a tower, a nave with north and south
aisles, and a chancel. <a name="citation47"></a><a
href="#footnote47" class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp; In the chancel
is a tablet to the memory of the Rev. Henry Shepherd, who was
rector of this parish thirty-four years, and died in January
1764, aged 62.&nbsp; The advowson of the rectory belongs to the
Bishop of Carlisle.</p>
<h3>CONINGSBY,</h3>
<p>In Domesday Cuningesbi, is a considerable village on the banks
of <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>the
river Bane, about eight miles from Horncastle.&nbsp; The manor,
which was once possessed by the Marmions of Wintringham, has for
many years belonged to the Heathcote family, and is now the
property of Sir Gilbert Heathcote, Baronet, of Normanton in
Rutlandshire.&nbsp; The church consists of a tower of excellent
masonry, a nave, two aisles, and a chancel. <a
name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a>&nbsp; The rectory, which is in the
presentation of the lord <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>of the manor, was for several years
held by the Reverend John Dyer, the poet.&nbsp; It was here that
he finished his didactic poem of &ldquo;The <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Fleece.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died at this place in 1758, and
lies buried in the church; but there is no inscription to
perpetuate his memory.&nbsp; A congregation of General Baptists
was formed at this place, during the government of Cromwell: the
society still exists, with an endowment for the minister.</p>
<h3>LANGRIVILLE AND THORNTON LE FEN.</h3>
<p>The lands composing these parishes were chiefly those sold by
the commissioners appointed under the act for draining and
enclosing Wildmore Fen; Langriville also contains the portion
allotted to the Earl of Stamford and Warrington, in lieu of his
manorial rights over <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Armtree and Wildmore.&nbsp; In 1812,
an act of parliament was passed, rendering these lands, with
others, parochial, and approximating these two parishes to the
soke of Horncastle.</p>

53</span>BAUMBER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village of Baumber or Bamburgh
is situated in the hundred of Gartree, about four miles northward
of Horncastle, on the turnpike road leading from that place to
Lincoln.&nbsp; In the Domesday survey it is called Badeburgh,
which perhaps may signify Bane-burgh, or a town on the Bane, that
river forming the eastern boundary of the parish.&nbsp; At the
period of making that survey, Ulf and Gilbert de Gand are
mentioned as proprietors. <a name="citation53a"></a><a

"Stourton Hall, Baumber, Seat of Joseph Livesey, Esquire"
 src="images/p53s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The manor, together with the adjoining hamlet of Stourton
parva, once belonged to Thomas Dighton, Esquire, whose daughter
and heiress was married to Edward Clinton, second son of the
first Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; On failure of male issue in the
elder branch, the earldom devolved to the son of this Edward,
whose successors afterwards had the Dukedom of Newcastle
conferred on them.&nbsp; These estates continued in the
possession of this family until the latter part of the last
century, when they were sold to Thomas Livesey, Esquire, of
Blackbourn, in the county of Lancaster, whose son, Joseph
Livesey, Esquire, the present proprietor, resides thereon, in an
elegant mansion, which was completed in 1810.&nbsp; Part of the
residence of the Earls of Lincoln is still standing.</p>
<p>The church at Baumber with all its appurtenances, and eight
oxgangs of land, were given by Gilbert de Gaunt to the monks at
Bridlington, which grant Pope Innocent the fourth, and the Bishop
of Lincoln confirmed. <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a>&nbsp; It is now a
donative, extrajudicial.&nbsp; It was rebuilt about sixty years
ago, and is a very neat brick structure, consisting of a tower, a
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>nave with
side aisles, and a chancel. <a name="citation54"></a><a
href="#footnote54" class="citation">[54]</a>&nbsp; Under the
chancel is the vault of the Newcastle family, which was their
place of sepulture previous to disposing of their estates in this
parish.&nbsp; Over the vault are the following inscriptions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lieth the Body of Francis Clinton
al&rsquo;s Fynes Esq. Grandson of Henry Lord Clinton Earl of
Lincoln who departed this life Feb. 5 Anno Dom. 1681.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here lieth the Body of Priscilla the Wife of Francis
Clinton al&rsquo;s Fynes Esq. who departed this life Febr. 15
Anno Dom. 1679.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the north aisle is a stone with this inscription in black
letters around the verge:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Orate p&rsquo; a&rsquo;iabus Joh&rsquo;es
Eland armig&rsquo;i Alicie et Elisabeth uxor ejusde&rsquo; qui
Joh&rsquo;es obijt xix die marcii a&ordm; d&rsquo;ni millo

<p>In 1821, the population of this parish amounted to 319, and
the number of houses to 51.</p>

55</span>EDLINGTON.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time of forming the Domesday
survey, this place, then called Tedlintune formed part of the
soke of Horncastle; <a name="citation55"></a><a

in the hundred of Gartree.&nbsp; It is very pleasantly situated
about two miles northward of Horncastle, near to the road leading
from that place to Lincoln.</p>
<p>The manorial estates comprising the chief part of the parish,
are the property of Richard Samuel Short, Esquire, a descendant
of a female branch of the family of that name, which he adopted
on coming into possession of the estates.&nbsp; The manor house,
the seat of the proprietor, though not of regular architecture,
acquires an agreeable effect from the grove in which it is
situated.&nbsp; From the house the prospect to the south-west,
over the adjacent level country, is both extensive and
pleasing.</p>

<p>The church is a small building possessing no claim to
attention.&nbsp; The vicarage is in the gift of the Duchy of
Lancaster.&nbsp; The rectorial tythes belong to the grammar
school at Oakham, in the county of Rutland.</p>
<p>On under-draining a field in this parish, in the latter part
of the year 1819, several heaps of ox bones were dug up, and with
each heap an urn of baked clay, apparently of Roman manufacture;
but unfortunately none of the urns were taken up whole.&nbsp; To
account for these relics being found here, it is probable that on
this spot a Roman sacrifice had been celebrated, in honor of some
deity, on the occasion of a victory, or in the exercise of other
pagan rites.</p>
<p>Annexed to this parish is the hamlet or manor of Poolham,
anciently called Polum.&nbsp; It formed part of the barony of
Gilbert de Gaunt until about the thirty-fifth year of Edward the
first, when <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Robert de Barkeworthe died seized of it; <a
name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a> and it appears to have been the
residence of Walterus de Barkeworthe, who died in 1347, and was
buried in the cloister of Lincoln cathedral.&nbsp; Afterwards it
was the residence of the family of Thimbleby, a branch of the
Thimblebys of Irnham, <a name="citation56b"></a><a
href="#footnote56b" class="citation">[56b]</a> who probably built
the mansion house within the ancient moat, about the time of
Henry the eighth.&nbsp; The Savilles of Howley in the County of
York, enjoyed the estate in the reign of Elizabeth, and in 1600,
Sir John Saville, Knight, sold it to George Bolles, Esquire,
citizen of London, whose descendant Sir John Bolles, Baronet,
conveyed the same to Sir Edmund Turnor, of Stoke Rochford,
Knight, and it is now the inheritance of Edmund Turnor, Esquire.
<a name="citation56c"></a><a href="#footnote56c"
class="citation">[56c]</a></p>
<p>Within the moat, beside the mansion house, are the remains of
a chapel, built of stone, a font, and a grave-stone with the date
1527.</p>
<p>In 1821, the parish of Edlington contained 37 houses, and 263
inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> village of Tupholme stands
nearly a mile from the north bank of the river Witham, at the
distance of seven miles west by north from Horncastle; and is
contained in the hundred of Wraggoe. <a name="citation57a"></a><a
href="#footnote57a" class="citation">[57a]</a></p>
<p>In the time of Henry the second, an Abbey of premonstratensian
canons, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was founded here, by Allan
de Nevill and Gilbert his brother, and endowed by them with their
possessions in this place, together with estates in other parts
of the county.&nbsp; This abbey also had numerous benefactions in
lands and churches, from other persons; and the king gave a
canal, so large, that ships might pass between the Witham and
Tupholme.&nbsp; These gifts were confirmed to the abbot and
canons, by charter, from Henry the third, in the twentieth year
of his reign. <a name="citation57b"></a><a href="#footnote57b"
class="citation">[57b]</a>&nbsp; At the dissolution of
monasteries, this abbey contained nine religious: and in the
thirtieth year of Henry the eighth, the scite was granted to Sir

<p>Of the abbey, a wall only is now remaining, the upper part of
which appears to have formed a side of the refectory or dining
hall.&nbsp; It contains lancet windows, and a small gallery, in
which the person sat who read to the brethren during their meals:
a practice which was common in all monasteries, and anciently in
colleges.&nbsp; The story beneath the refectory appears to have
been vaulted, and was probably used as a cellar.&nbsp; Adjoining
to the ruins is a farm house, which has been built out of part of
the materials.&nbsp; The gate house, now gone, was standing when
Dr. Stukeley visited this place in 1716.&nbsp; A view of it is
engraved in the Itinerarium Curiosum.</p>

pleasantly situated on the wolds, in the hundred of Hill, at
about the distance of six miles east from Horncastle.</p>
<p>The manorial estates, which comprise the whole parish, have
for many years been the property of a family named Burton.&nbsp;
The present proprietor is William Raynor Burton, Esquire, which
latter name he assumed on coming into possession of the estates
on the death of his uncle, Robert Burton, Esquire, of
Lincoln.</p>
<p>On the south side of the church, near to the porch, is an
elegant stone cross, which having escaped both the ravages of
time, and the destruction of the Puritans, remains in so perfect
a state as to be justly esteemed of unrivalled excellence and
beauty.&nbsp; The extreme height of it, including the subcourse,
is fifteen feet.&nbsp; The shaft is octagonal, and decorated with
a capital, surmounted by a coronal of small embattlements.&nbsp;
The cross, with its pediment, which rises from this, is
ornamented on the south face with the representation of the
crucified founder of the christian faith, and on the opposite
side with that of the virgin and child.</p>
<p>The church is a small building, consisting of a tower, nave,
and chancel, and is void of architectural interest. <a

Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, and had issue Charles his heir, and
three other sons who died infants, and a daughter Susannah.&nbsp;

61</span>SCRIVELSBY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> two miles south of
Horncastle, on the road leading from that place to Boson, stands
the village of Scrivelsby, which is included in the Hundred of
Gartree.</p>
<p>At the time of compiling the Domesday survey, it appears that
part of this parish, then called Scrivelesbi, was annexed to the
Soke of Horncastle, which was then retained by the conqueror. <a
name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a"
class="citation">[61a]</a>&nbsp; By the same record, the manor
appears to have been then holden by Robert de Spenser, but by
what service is not said.&nbsp; How it passed from De Spenser to
the family of Marmyon; whether by inheritance, or escheat of the
crown, and subsequent grant, cannot now be ascertained.&nbsp; It
was however shortly after in the tenure of Robert Marmyon, whose
male descendants enjoyed the same until the twentieth year of
Edward the first, 1292, when Philip the last Lord Marmyon died
seized of this manor, holden by barony, and the service of
champion to the kings of England on their coronation day; and
seized also of the castle of Tamworth in Warwickshire, held
therewith as parcel of his barony, but by the service of
knight&rsquo;s fees, to attend the king in his wars in Wales. <a
name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b"
class="citation">[61b]</a>&nbsp; This Philip had only female
issue, and between them his great estates here, in Warwickshire,
Leicestershire, and elsewhere, were divided.&nbsp; By this
partition, the manor and barony of Scrivelsby were allotted to
Joan, the youngest daughter, by whose grand-daughter and heir the
same passed in marriage to Sir John Dymoke, who, with Margaret
his wife, had livery thereof in the twenty-third year of Edward
the third.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>At the
coronation of Richard the second, Sir John Dymoke claimed in
right of his wife, to perform the office of champion: this right
was counterclaimed by Baldwin Freville, who, as lord of Tamworth,
also claimed to perform that service; but the commissioners of
the court of claims deciding in favor of Sir John Dymoke, he
performed that office; and from that period to the present time,
nearly five hundred years, their male issue have continued in
possession of the same inheritance.&nbsp; The present champion,
the Reverend John Dymoke, is the seventeenth of his family, from
Sir John Dymoke, who has inherited that high and singular office.

chief part of Scrivelsby Court, the ancient baronial seat, was
destroyed by fire, between fifty and sixty years ago.&nbsp; In
the part consumed was a very large hall, on the pannels of the
wainscottings of which were depicted the various arms and
alliances of the family, through all its numerous and far traced
descents.&nbsp; The loss has been in some degree compensated for,
by the addition which the late proprietor recently made to those

<p>The church is a small building, consisting of a nave, with a
north aisle, and a chancel.&nbsp; At the eastern end of the aisle
are two tombs, on one of which is the figure of a knight, in
chain armour, cross-legged; on the other that of a lady, with a
lion at her feet.&nbsp; By the side of these is the tomb of Sir
Robert Dymoke, who was champion at the coronations of Richard the
third, Henry the seventh, and Henry the eighth; by the last of
whom he was made a knight banneret.&nbsp; On the top of the tomb
is a plate of brass, on which is sculptured his figure in full
armour, in a recumbent posture, with his helmet under his head,
and a lion at his feet.&nbsp; Above him is a shield, containing
arms, and under him is the following inscription, in black

66</span>BOLINGBROKE.</h2>
<h3>SITUATION.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Bolingbroke</span>, a decayed market town,
is distant about eight miles south east from Horncastle, and
gives name to the soke wherein it is situated.&nbsp; The town is
seated on a clear, rapid brook, from which the name is derived,
and which runs along a peculiar deep recess of rugged sand-stone
hills, which suddenly terminate at the northern border of the
adjacent fen district.&nbsp; Embayed amid these deep declivities,
and having but one narrow outlet into the level land, it is a
matter of no surprize that its importance as a place of security
was not overlooked in the feodal times, when it became further
strengthened by a castle.</p>
<h3>THE MANOR.</h3>
<p>The manor appears to have been, from an early period,
connected with the dignity of the Earldom of Lincoln.&nbsp;
Ranulph, an illustrious nobleman, marrying Lucia, widow of Roger
de Romara, sister, and heiress of Morcar, the Saxon Earl of
Northumberland and Lincoln, delivered the estates, amongst which
was this lordship, to Henry the first, for the dignity of the
Earldom of Chester.&nbsp; Against this, William de Romara, son of
Lucia by her former husband, appealed to the king, but in
vain.&nbsp; William however strengthening by his interest the
rebellion in Normandy which had been raised by Robert, the eldest
son of the conqueror and brother of the king; Henry, to appease
his wrath, and obtain his favor, was in the twenty-second year of
his reign, induced to restore to him the estates of his mother
Lucia, and invest him with the Earldom of Lincoln.&nbsp; After
this, exchanging certain lands in Normandy with Robert de Tillol
for the lordships of Hareby, Enderby, and Hundleby, parts of this
soke, William was <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>invited by the security of the situation, to erect his
castle at Bolingbroke.&nbsp; About the same time asserting the
rights of the Empress Maud, in her contentions with Stephen for
the throne, he greatly contributed to her early successes,
particularly at the siege of Lincoln.</p>
<p>By his wife Maud, the daughter of Richard de Redvers, he had
issue a son named William, who married Hawise daughter of Stephen
Earl of Albemarle; but dying in the life time of his father, the
estates descended to his son, also called William.&nbsp; This
William, the third of that name, to further improve his fortress,
and add to the advantages of its situation, procured from Simon
Briton, who also held lands in these parts, remission of all his
claims in the whole marsh of Bolingbroke, and from Jeffrey Fitz
Stephens, the superior of the Knights Templar, a full release of
their interest in all the fens belonging to this manor, and its
soke, which William de Romara his grandfather had given to
them.</p>
<p>This last mentioned individual of the family of Romara died
without issue, and in him the male line of the family ceased;
which appears from Gilbert de Gaunt, after being a suppliant
prisoner when fighting on the side of Stephen at the siege of
Lincoln, and compelled by the first William de Romara to marry
his daughter Hawise, becoming in her right possessor of this
manor, and receiving also the Earldom of Lincoln.</p>
<p>Gilbert de Gaunt, died in the second year of the reign of
Henry the second, and left issue, two daughters, Alice and
Gunnora; the former of whom was married to Simon de St. Liz, Earl
of Huntingdon, who is said to have enjoyed, during her life time,
the Earldom of Lincoln, and with it this lordship.&nbsp; Alice as
well as her sister Gunnora dying without issue, their uncle
Robert de Gaunt, though unallied by blood, became their heir, and
possessed himself of these estates.&nbsp; Gilbert his son
succeeded him; but joining the cause of the barons against King
John, and afterwards against his son and successor, Henry the
third, he was defeated at Lincoln, taken prisoner, and these
estates conferred upon Ranulph de Meschines, surnamed de
Blundeville, Earl of Chester, who being third in descent from
Ranulph Earl of Chester, by his wife Lucia, the widow of Roger de
Romara, had, independent of the claims on his sovereign for
aiding in firmly establishing his family on the throne, a natural
right, superior to that of the family of de Gaunt.&nbsp; Ranulph
de Blundeville dying without <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>issue, his sisters became his
co-heiresses; but he had during his life time assigned by charter
to one of them, named Hawise, the Earldom of Lincoln, and with it
this manor and castle.</p>
<p>Robert, son and heir of Sayer de Quincy, Earl of Winchester,
marrying Hawise, left issue, a daughter, Margaret, who was
married to John de Laci, a descendant of the Barons of
Pontefract.&nbsp; John de Laci received from Henry the third a
charter of confirmation of the Earldom of Lincoln, and the
inheritances which he possessed by his wife Margaret de
Quincy.</p>
<p>Edmund his son dying before his mother, did not inherit the
Earldom, though he received the tertium denarium of the
county.&nbsp; He left issue, Henry, John, and Margaret, the
former of whom succeeded to this manor and the Earldom of
Lincoln; and is said to have been the most exalted nobleman of
his time.&nbsp; He is stated to have been illustrious in counsel,
undaunted in the fight, chief among the warriors of his country,
and in fine, the brightest ornament of the reign. <a
name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68"
class="citation">[68]</a>&nbsp; His sons dying young, he
bequeathed by will all his possessions to the heirs of Edmund
Plantagenet, in case of failure of issue by his daughter
Alice.&nbsp; Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, son of Edmund
Plantagenet, marrying Alice, held in her right, the estates of
her father Henry de Laci, who, on his death bed, desirous that
his son in law should be ennobled not only by the attendant
riches, but also by the influence of his example, enjoined him to
devote his power to secure the liberties of his country.&nbsp;
But the proud and resolute spirit of the Earl of Lancaster needed
no such injunctions to spur him on to action.&nbsp; Indignant
that Hugh de Spenser should enjoy the favor of his sovereign,
Edward the second, he after effecting the destruction of Piers
Gaveston, broke out into open rebellion: defeated however at
Boroughbridge, he was ignominiously put to death at his castle of
Pontefract, and his estates forfeited to the crown.&nbsp; The
inheritances which were, as has been before noticed, the right of
his wife, were still reserved to her: but having borne an
indifferent reputation for chastity; following the impulses of
her amours in the life time of her late husband, and after his
death marrying without the consent of the king to Eubold le
Estrange; the king, with whom but trivial pretences were
sufficient for <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>abridging the powers of any individual allied to his
haughty relatives of the house of Lancaster, seized for this
breach of fealty, or homage, all the inheritance which she held
of the crown in chief, among which were this manor, and that of
Denbigh, and conferred the whole on his favorite Hugh de
Spenser.</p>
<p>Henry, brother of Thomas the late Earl of Lancaster, procured
in the first parliament after the accession of Edward the third,
a remission of the forfeited estates of the family; and upon the
death of the countess Alice, the wife of his late brother, her
honors and splendid inheritances devolved to him, partly by the
will of her father Henry de Laci, and partly by reason of a
render made by him to Edward the first, and a re-grant by charter
from that monarch to the heirs of Henry de Laci, with remainder
to the heirs of Edmund Plantagenet.</p>
<p>Henry Earl of Lancaster died without male issue, but left two
daughters Maud and Blanche; the former of whom married William of
Bavaria, and left no issue; but Blanche became the sole heir of
her father, and married John of Gaunt, who, by reason of the
inheritances, was created Duke of Lancaster.&nbsp; By her he had
issue, at the castle at this place, the celebrated Henry of
Bolingbroke; upon whose accession to the throne, the whole
patrimony, through the line of Lancaster, became invested in the
crown; and in his reign was counted one of the manorial
possessions of the king, denominated honors.</p>
<h3>THE CASTLE.</h3>
<p>On the south side of the town is the scite of the castle,
which is now only to be distinguished by the traces of its
foundations, encompassed by a moat.</p>
<p>The seclusion of this spot amongst steep hills, with only an
opening to the level country, southward, rendered it in the early
mode of warfare a desirable situation for a place of defence,
since it was at all times secure from the emergencies of a sudden
surprise.&nbsp; The advantages of such a situation were not
overlooked by William de Romara, who about the early part of the
reign of king Stephen, erected his castle at this place.</p>
<p>From the testimony of Mr. Gervase Holles, who is the only
person that has left us a description of this castle, it appears
to have been a very spacious square edifice, characterized in its
construction by <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>strength and uniformity, and containing beside numerous
apartments, all the conveniences of warfare. <a
name="citation70"></a><a href="#footnote70"
class="citation">[70]</a>&nbsp; By queen Elizabeth it was
improved <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>by elegant and extensive erections, and though
afterwards neglected, yet it remained a place of importance down
to the time of the civil wars in the reign of Charles the first,
when for some time it withstood a siege by the parliamentary
forces.</p>
<p>After the defeat of the royal army at Winceby, this castle was
compelled to yield to the army of the parliament, who, after
dismantling it, left it silently to decay.&nbsp; For a many years
part of a circular building, said to be the gate-house, continued
standing; but in May 1815, the last remaining fragment of this
once formidable structure fell to the ground.</p>
<p>To the east of the enclosure may be seen the entrenchments,
behind which the assailants, in 1643, protected themselves in
their attack on this castle.</p>

</a></p>
<h3>THE CHURCH.</h3>
<p>The church being occupied by the parliamentary forces when
they stormed the castle, was almost entirely demolished by the
cannon of that fortress.</p>
<p>The part now remaining, is situated a short distance north of
the scite of the castle, and consists of a tower, and a part
appropriated for public worship, which was once the southern
aisle of the original edifice.&nbsp; It is built of sand stone,
and if the delicate tracery of its windows be excepted, it
contains but little architectural beauty.&nbsp; These windows
were once ornamented with richly stained glass, of which not a
fragment is now remaining. <a name="citation71"></a><a
href="#footnote71" class="citation">[71]</a></p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>There
is yet preserved in this church the mutilated remains of an
embroidered cloth for the communion table, said to have been
wrought by one of the Duchesses of Lancaster.</p>
<p>Two chantries, which formerly were attached to this church,
were suppressed at the dissolution of religious houses, in the
twenty-sixth year of the reign of Henry the eighth.</p>
<p>The rectory is in the presentation of Lady Eyre of Mortlake,
in Surrey.</p>
<h3>THE TOWN.</h3>
<p>At so early a period as the time of forming the Domesday
survey, this town appears to have arisen into some consideration
as a place of trade, being possessed of a market, which however
is in that record denominated a new one. <a
name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a></p>
<p>For a many years it was considered one of the principal market
towns of the county of Lincoln; but its trade, for some time
previous to the destruction of the castle, had been gradually
withdrawing to <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>other places more conveniently situated; and afterwards
the town fell rapidly into decay, and its market became wholly
unfrequented.</p>
<p>Although it may be at present identified as a mere village;
yet its widely detached houses, partially paved streets, and
grass grown market place, connected with the mounds of the castle
which once adorned the spot, evince sufficiently that there has
been a time when destitution was not the characteristic of the
town of Bolingbroke.</p>
<p>An attempt has lately been made to revive the market, on a
portion of land allotted to this parish on the enclosure of the
fens, in lieu of right of common thereon.&nbsp; An annual fair on
the tenth of July, is held both at this town and on the fen
allotment.</p>
<p>There is a free school at this place, founded and endowed in
1588, by a Mr. Chamberlain.</p>
<p>In 1821, this parish contained 158 houses, and 753
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Bolingbroke gives the title of viscount to the family of St.
John, of Lydiard Tregoze, in Wiltshire.</p>
<h2><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>REVESBY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Revesby</span> is situated at the distance
of six miles south from Horncastle, on the road from that place
to Boston, and is included in the soke of Bolingbroke.</p>
<p>What now constitues the parish of Revesby, appears formerly to
have been three distinct manors, Revesby, Thoresby, and
Seithesby; the greater part of which was the property of William
de Romara, Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; In the year 1142 he founded a
Cistertian monastery at this place, and previous to endowing it
with the whole of his possessions here, he negotiated exchanges
with the other proprietors, by which he was enabled to give the
entirety of the three manors to his new monastery. <a
name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a></p>
<p>To add to the solemnity of the ceremony of foundation, the
Earl on this occasion manumitted several slaves, who had
petitioned for their liberty.&nbsp; One of them, called Wilhelmus
Medicus, was doubtless a physician; another, Rogerus Barkarius,
probably a shepherd: the surnames of persons at that time being
derived from their professions.&nbsp; A person named Roger Barker
resided until lately at a place called Stickney Wydale.&nbsp;
This place belongs to the parish of Revesby, though about four
miles distant, and is supposed to have been given to the monks,
on condition of their keeping Nordyke Causeway, formerly a
dangerous pass, in repair.</p>
<p>Beside the endowment of William de Romara, the monastery was
enriched by numerous other benefactions.&nbsp; At the dissolution
of religious houses, its possessions with all its rights were
granted to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk; and on the death of
his two infant sons, who survived him only a short time, their
extensive possessions were divided among the heirs general.&nbsp;
On this division, Revesby fell <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>to the lot of the Carsey family, who
resided here several years, and afterwards sold it to the Lord
Treasurer Burleigh, from whom it descended to the first and
second Earls of Exeter; the latter of whom settled it on his
grandson, Henry Howard, the third son of the Earl of
Berkshire.&nbsp; About a century ago it was sold by the
descendants of Henry Howard, to Joseph Banks, Esquire, the great
grandfather of the late Right Honorable Sir Joseph Banks,
Baronet, whose widow is the present possessor.</p>

family of Banks.&nbsp; Part of an ancient mansion, formerly the
residence of the abbots, now forms the offices.&nbsp; The
monastery, which stood at a considerable distance, has long been

<h3>THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR JOSEPH BANKS, BARONET.</h3>
<p>The subject of this memoir was born in London on the 13th of
December, 1743.&nbsp; He was the only son of William Banks,
Esquire, of Revesby, who died in 1761, leaving him, at the age of
eighteen, possessed of an ample fortune.&nbsp; He was at that
time a member of the University of Oxford; and it was in the
retirement of collegiate studies that he acquired his taste for
natural history.</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>Immediately on his leaving the University, in 1763, he
made a voyage to the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, and
returned with those habits of investigation which are induced by
a contemplation of rare and novel objects.</p>
<p>Having become a member of the Royal Society, his desire for
further investigation of new worlds was again excited by the plan
proposed by that learned body, for observing the expected transit
of Venus, from one of the South Sea islands.&nbsp; No sooner did
Mr. Banks understand that the Endeavour, commanded by Captain
(then Lieutenant) Cook, was equipping for her voyage, and
intended to prosecute further discovery after the observation of
the transit, than he determined to embark in the
expedition.&nbsp; Mr. Banks entered upon his preparations with a
most generous spirit; providing himself with two draughtsmen, a
secretary, and four servants, together with all the necessary
books, and instruments.&nbsp; He was also accompanied by Dr.
Solander, a Swedish gentleman, who had been the pupil of
Linn&aelig;us.</p>
<p>On the 26th of August, 1768, the Endeavour sailed from
Plymouth, on this great expedition.&nbsp; In the passage to
Madeira, Mr. Banks and his companions discovered many marine
animals, which no naturalist had described.&nbsp; At Madeira, and
as they sailed on to Rio Janeiro, their vigilance was still
eagerly awake, and sufficiently gratified by observations and
specimens new to science.&nbsp; The jealousy of the Portuguese
greatly disappointed their curiosity, by forbidding their
researches at Rio Janeiro.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 12, 1769, the Endeavour arrived at
Otaheite.&nbsp; For three months the voyagers continued at this
and the contiguous isles, making the astronomical observations,
for the sake chiefly of which Lieutenant Cook was sent out;
surveying, as navigators, the coasts of the different isles;
collecting specimens of the natural productions peculiar to them;
and studying the language, manners, and arts of the
islanders.</p>
<p>In August, 1769, the Endeavour sailed from the last isle of
the group.&nbsp; In October they made New Zealand, which had not
been visited since Tasman&rsquo;s voyage.&nbsp; They next sailed
to New Holland, chiefly along the East coast, and gave the name
of New South Wales to the adjacent territory.&nbsp; The ship here
struck upon a rock, and was saved only by extraordinary
skill.&nbsp; In laying her down for repairs the sea broke in, and
spoiled the greater part of Mr. Banks&rsquo;s specimens <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>of natural
history: but he was recompensed by the discovery of the
kangaroo.&nbsp; In August, 1770, they sailed for New
Guinea.&nbsp; On their homeward voyage, their short stay at
Batavia was nearly fatal to the expedition.&nbsp; Mr. Banks and
Dr. Solander caught the fever.&nbsp; Tupia, a priest, and a boy
named Tayeto, both from Otaheite, who were proceeding to England,
died.&nbsp; Every person of the crew but one was taken ill.&nbsp;
Seven died at Batavia, and twenty-three more within six weeks
after.&nbsp; On the 12th of June, 1771, the vessel anchored in
the downs.</p>
<p>Early in 1772 an expedition was prepared under the command of
Captain Cook, to proceed in search of the so much talked of
Southern Continent, in which Mr. Banks most anxiously took a
part, intending to perform the voyage; and he accordingly
prepared his establishment upon the most extensive scale.&nbsp;
On this account orders were given by the Admiralty for fitting
the ships out with every possible accommodation that Mr. Banks
could desire; but when the Resolution sailed from Long Reach for
Plymouth, she was found so very crank, from the additional upper
works, that she was obliged to be carried into Sheerness to have
the additional cabins cut away, with such other alterations as
were necessary to make her sea-worthy.&nbsp; This of course
struck at the very root of Mr. Banks&rsquo;s project, in
curtailing him of the space and accommodation absolutely
necessary for the establishment which he had formed; and he was
reluctantly compelled to give up his plans.</p>
<p>Disappointed in this expedition, Mr. Banks was prompted to
engage in some other active research, and accordingly determined
on a voyage to Iceland and the western islands of Scotland;
partly for the purpose of scientific observation, and, as Van
Troil states, who accompanied him, in order to keep together and
employ the draughtsmen, and other persons, who had been engaged
for the South Sea expedition.</p>
<p>They sailed from the river in July, and called at Portsmouth,
thence to Plymouth, and proceeded up St. George&rsquo;s Channel,
to the Western Islands, visiting Oransay, Columbkill, Scarba, and
Staffa, so remarkable for its basaltic columns, but until then
comparatively unknown.&nbsp; They passed the Orkneys and Shetland
islands without any particular investigation; and on the 28th of
August, 1772, arrived off the coast of Iceland.&nbsp; After
completely investigating every thing curious, they left Iceland,
and arrived at Edinburgh in November, from whence they set off by
land for London.</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>After
his return Mr. Banks passed his time principally in London, or at
his paternal seat at Revesby, surrounded by men of letters, and
by persons of the first rank and fortune; and dedicating his time
and fortune to scientific pursuits.</p>
<p>Sir John Pringle having retired from the office of President
of the Royal Society in 1777, Mr. Banks was called to fill the
vacant chair, when his ample fortune enabled him to commence a
system by which his house became, through a long series of years,
a scene of hospitality, to genius of every country, and of every
rank in society.</p>
<p>The close attention which the President now paid to the duties
of his station, induced him to select a rural retirement nearer
to London than his seat at Revesby; he therefore, in the year
1779, took a lease of the premises, which he afterwards
purchased, at Spring Grove, in the parish of Heston, in
Middlesex; and on the 29th of March in the same year, he married
Dorothea, daughter and co-heiress of William Weston Hugeson,
Esquire, of Provender, in the parish of Norton, county of
Kent.</p>
<p>In 1781, Mr. Banks was honored by his Sovereign with a
baronetcy; as he was some years afterwards, by being created a
Knight of the Bath, and sworn one of his Majesty&rsquo;s
Honorable Privy Counsel.</p>
<p>Sir Joseph was re-elected to the Presidency of the Royal
Society, for several years, with an unanimous feeling; but the
jealousies of some members of splendid and commanding talents
began to be developed.&nbsp; It was charged against him, that in
the recommendation of candidates, he bowed rather to the
pretensions of rank, than to the unobtrusive, but undoubted
claims of eminent ability.&nbsp; This feeling so far extended
itself, that in 1784, a dignitary of the church, distinguished
for his mathematical learning, threatened a secession in the
following terms:&mdash;&ldquo;If other remedies fail, we can at
least secede.&nbsp; When the hour of secession comes, the
President will be left with his train of feeble amateurs, and
that toy upon the table, the ghost of that society in which
Philosophy once reigned, and Newton presided as her
minister.&rdquo;&nbsp; The very temper of this burst of eloquence
is a proof of the causes of the schism.&nbsp; The pride of genius
was opposed to the pride of rank, and the conflict was as
obstinate as it was violent.&nbsp; The President maintained his
position firmly, and he lived to behold that intimate union which
ought ever to exist between the patrons and the votaries of
learning.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Beside
devoting his attention to the duties of the chair of the Royal
Society, Sir Joseph became an active member of all the public
societies of the day; and to his care in a great degree the
African Association owes its origin.&nbsp; He also liberally
encouraged and assisted those who undertook voyages or travels of
discovery.&nbsp; In his attentions to the breeding of sheep and
cattle, and to the improvements in husbandry, he gave many
instances of scientific patriotism; and to his exertions may be
attributed the drainage of the Fens in the immediate vicinity of
Revesby.&nbsp; To the Horticultural society, which he assisted in
forming, he was a contributor of several papers.&nbsp; In
politics he took no ostensible part, and had not even a seat in
parliament.</p>
<p>During the latter years of his life, Sir Joseph was so
severely afflicted with the gout, as to be deprived of the use of
his lower extremities, and consequently unable to take his
accustomed exercise.&nbsp; In 1817 he was by death deprived of
his sister, a loss which he severely felt.&nbsp; In April, 1820,
in consequence of increasing debility, he expressed a wish to
resign his office of President of the Royal Society, but this
resignation the society were unwilling to accept of, and he
continued to hold the office until his death, which took place on
the 19th of the following month.&nbsp; His remains were interred
in the church yard at Heston.&nbsp; Having no issue, his title is
extinct.&nbsp; After the death of his widow, his estates in
Lincolnshire go to the Honorable James Hamilton Stanhope, and Sir
Henry Hawley, Baronet; the remainder of his estates to Sir Edward
Knatchbull, Baronet.&nbsp; His valuable and extensive library he
bequeathed to the British Museum.</p>
<h2><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>KIRKSTEAD.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Kirkstead</span>, anciently called
Cristed, is situated on the east bank of the Witham, in the
hundred of Gartree, and is about three miles distant from
Tattershall, and eight from Horncastle.&nbsp; Formerly it was a
hamlet of Kirkby super Bane, but for many years it has been
considered as a separate parish.</p>
<p>The manor, with that of Tattershall, was among the several
estates given by the conqueror to Eudo, one of his Norman
followers.&nbsp; His son Hugh fitz Eudo, called the Breton,
founded a Cistertian Abbey here in 1139, and endowed it with his
possessions in this place.&nbsp; Afterwards the monks,
considering the situation unhealthy, petitioned Robert, the son
of the founder, to allow them to remove the abbey to some other
place; but though they obtained permission, yet it does not
appear that the affair was proceeded in any further.&nbsp; The
abbey had subsequently many benefactors, and acquired very
extensive possessions.</p>
<p>At the dissolution of religious houses, the Kirkstead estate
was given by Henry the eighth, to Charles Duke of Suffolk; and on
the division of his estates after the death of his two sons, who
survived him but a short time, it reverted to the king at one of
the heirs general of the family, and was subsequently given to
Lord Clinton and Saye, afterwards Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; This
estate descended to Mr. Daniel Disney, in right of his wife
Catherine, the youngest daughter of Henry Fynes Clinton, Esquire,
and grand-daughter of the second Earl of Lincoln.&nbsp; In the
year 1792 it was sold by Mr. Disney Fytch, grand-son of Mr.
Daniel Disney, to the present possessor, Richard Ellison,
Esquire, of Sudbroke Holme, near Lincoln.</p>
<p>Of the Abbey a small ruin only remains: but from a plate of
&ldquo;The Ichnography of the Monastery of Kirsted Linc.&rdquo;
in Stukeley&rsquo;s Itinerarium Curiosum, the buildings appear to
have been extensive.</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>South
of the ruin of the Abbey is the Chapel, a very curious building,
which according to tradition was built previous to the
monastery.&nbsp; It is of early English architecture, having
lancet windows at the sides and east end, and an ox-eye window
over the entrance at the west end.&nbsp; The roof is beautifully
groined, the ribs springing from corbel tables; and against the
south wall on the inside, is a rude figure in stone of a knight
templar, with the front part of his helmet in the shape of a
cross.&nbsp; For many years the roof of this building was covered
with thatch, but in 1790 it was removed and a covering of tiles
substituted.&nbsp; At that time also the bell, which had
previously hung in a tree, was placed over the west end of the
building.</p>

</a></p>
<p>This chapel is a donative of exempt jurisdiction, but appears
to have had no stipend for the officiating minister until it came
into the possession of Mr. Daniel Disney, who being a
presbyterian, appointed a minister of that persuasion to perform
service there, with a salary of &pound;30. per annum. <a
name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a>&nbsp; In order that the tenets which he
professed might not want support in his parish, in 1720 he
settled certain lands upon five trustees, the profits of which
were to be applied to the maintenance of a presbyterian minister
at this place.&nbsp; This gift he afterwards confirmed by his
will in 1732, and in addition, bequeathed to the trustees the use
of the chapel and chapel ground for the same purpose.&nbsp; On
the death or alienation of the minister, the trustees were to
present the names of two to the lord of the manor, who was to
appoint one of them, and on his neglect or refusal, the trustees
themselves were to make the appointment.&nbsp; Ministers
continued to be nominated by the prescribed form until the death
of Mr. Dunkley, who had for many years received the bequeathed
stipend, and whose demise took place in 1794.&nbsp; On that
occasion the present owner of the manor took possession of the
estates which had been conveyed to the trustees, and appointed to
the chapel a minister of the Church of England, paying him
&pound;30. per annum.&nbsp; The trustees recovered possession of
the estates, by an action of ejectment, tried at Lincoln summer
assizes, 1812; but not of the chapel.&nbsp; A new chapel was
erected and the presbyterian form of worship re-established here
in 1822.</p>
<p><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>This
village gave birth to the celebrated monk Hugh de Kirkstead, who
is styled by Fuller &ldquo;a Benedictine Cistertian Bernardine
Monk, or, as it may be termed a treble refined
Christian.&rdquo;&nbsp; He, and Serlo, one of his own order,
joined in composing a chronicle of the Cistertians from their
first arrival in England in 1131, to their own time, about
1210.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth volume of the &ldquo;Archeologia of the
Society of Antiquaries&rdquo; is an engraving of an ancient iron
candlestick of a very singular construction, six of which were
found in cleaning the bed of the river Witham near this
place.</p>
<p>This village contained, according to the returns of 1821, 24
houses and 132 inhabitants.</p>

84</span>TATTERSHALL.</h2>
<h3>SITUATION.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Tattershall</span> or Tateshall is a small
market town in the wapentake of Gartree.&nbsp; It is situated on
the banks of the river Bane, near its junction with the river
Witham, and is distant nine miles south west from
Horncastle.&nbsp; It is a place of considerable antiquity, having
been a Roman military station; traces of two encampments of that
warlike people being still visible, at a short distance from the
town, in a place called Tattershall park.&nbsp; Several Roman
coins have also been found in different parts of the parish.</p>
<h3>THE MANOR.</h3>
<p>Shortly after the conquest, the lordship of Tattershall,
together with the hamlet of Tattershall Thorpe, and several other
estates, was given by King William to Eudo and Pin&ccedil;o, two
Norman nobles, who had attended him into England, but who, though
sworn brothers in war, were not otherwise related.&nbsp; On the
division of the estates between these chieftains, this manor
became the property of Eudo, who fixed his residence here.&nbsp;
Upon his death his estates descended to his son, Hugh Fitz Eudo,
who, in the year 1139, founded an abbey for Cistertian monks at
the neighbouring village of Kirkstead.</p>
<p>Hugh was succeeded by his son Robert, who left issue a son
named Philip.&nbsp; Philip, after serving the office of sheriff
of Berkshire in the seventh year of the reign of Richard the
second, and also of Lincolnshire in the eighth, ninth, and tenth
years of the same king, was succeeded by his son Robert, the
second of that name, who, in the year 1201, procured from King
John, by means of a present of a well-trained goshawk, a grant to
hold a weekly market on Thursday, on this manor.&nbsp; Robert was
followed by his son of the same name, who <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>about the
year 1230, obtained from Henry the third a licence to build a
castle at this place, together with a grant of free warren in all
his demesne lands.&nbsp; The male line of Eudo was continued in
regular descent, by Robert the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh;
upon the death of the latter of whom in his minority, it became
extinct, and the inheritance was divided between his three
sisters.&nbsp; Tattershall became the portion of Joan, one of the
co-heiresses, who married Sir Robert Driby, and who had issue by
him a daughter and heiress Alice, afterwards married to Sir
William Bernack.&nbsp; John, the son of this latter marriage, was
succeeded by William, who died a minor, and left his sister Maud
his heiress.</p>
<p>The Fitz Eudos, from the place, assumed the cognomen of
Tateshall, and by that title had summons to parliament among the
great barons of the realm.</p>
<p>Maud, the heiress of the Bernack family, married Sir Ralph,
afterwards Lord Cromwell, who, in her right, became lord of this
manor; and upon his death, which happened on the twenty-seventh
day of August, in the year 1398, left his son Ralph his heir, who
died in 1416, and was succeeded by a son of the same name.&nbsp;
In the year 1433, this latter Ralph was by Henry the sixth
appointed Treasurer of the Exchequer.&nbsp; He died without issue
on the fourth of January, 1455; whereby his two nieces, the
daughters of his sister, the wife of Sir Richard Stanhope, became
his co-heiresses.</p>
<p>It does not appear into whose hands the Tattershall estate
fell after the death of the Lord Treasurer Cromwell, until the
year 1487, when Henry the seventh granted the manor to his
mother, Margaret Countess of Richmond, and in the following year
entailed it on the Duke of Richmond.&nbsp; The Duke dying without
issue, Henry the eighth in 1520, granted it to Charles Duke of
Suffolk, by letters patent, which were confirmed by Edward the
sixth, in the year 1547.</p>
<p>On the death of the two infant sons of the Duke of Suffolk,
who survived their father only a short time, this manor again
came into the possession of the king, as one of the heirs general
of the family.&nbsp; By letters patent, dated the fifth of
September, 1551, Edward the sixth granted the castle with the
manor, in fee, to Edward Lord Clinton and Saye, afterwards Earl
of Lincoln.&nbsp; The Earl dying in 1584, was succeeded by his
son Henry, who died in 1616, leaving issue a son and heir Thomas,
who survived his father only two years, and was <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>followed by
his son Theophilus, who died in 1667.&nbsp; The next possessor
was Edward, who was the grandson of Theophilus, and who died at
Tattershall in 1692; in him terminated the male line of the
Clinton family.&nbsp; Upon his death, without issue, the
Tattershall estate became the property of his cousin Bridget, who
married Hugh Fortescue, Esquire, by whom she had a son and heir
Hugh, created in 1746, Baron Fortescue, and Earl Clinton.&nbsp;
Upon his death in 1751, his half brother Matthew succeeded him,
but dying in 1785, the Tattershall estate descended to his eldest
son, Earl Fortescue, the present possessor.</p>
<p>Besides the liberties of the parks, chases and free warrens,
belonging to the castle and manor of Tattershall, it also appears
in the several grants of Henry the third, Henry the fourth, Henry
the seventh, Henry the eighth, and in the grant of the liberties
of Richmond fee, whereof the castle and manor of Tattershall is a
part, that to the said castle and manor also belong the liberties
of stallage, tolls of markets and fairs, together with the
privilege for all tenants and inhabitants of Tattershall to be
discharged of any tolls in fairs and markets abroad; also the
sole liberties of fishing, fowling, hawking, and hunting, in all
the said manor, chases and the precincts of them; also suits of
courts baron, waifs, estrays, treasure trove, goods and chattels
of felons, fugitives, men outlawed, and felones de se, deodands,
bondmen, villains, with their sequels; and also that neither the
sheriff of the county, nor his bailiff shall arrest within the
said manor, and that no distress taken therein shall be
delivered, nor replevins granted by the sheriff, but only by the
steward of the lord of the said manor.</p>
<h3>THE CASTLE.</h3>
<p>About two hundred and fifty yards south-west of the town
stands the remains of the castle, a stately edifice, erected by
the Lord Treasurer Cromwell, about the year 1440.</p>
<p>William of Worcester states, that the Lord Treasurer expended
in building the principal and other towers of this castle above
four thousand marks; his household there consisted of one hundred
persons, and his suite, when he rode to London, commonly of one
hundred and twenty horsemen; and his annual expenditure was about
&pound;5000. <a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86"
class="citation">[86]</a></p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>This
castle was originally intended as a place of defence, and was
surrounded by two fosses, the inner one faced with brick, great
part of which is now remaining.&nbsp; Formerly it was of great
extent, but was dilapidated in the civil wars between the
unfortunate Charles the first and his parliament: for the damages
thereby sustained, Theophilus, fourth Earl of Lincoln, petitioned
parliament in the year 1649.</p>
<p>The part now remaining, is a rectangular brick tower of
exquisite workmanship, about one hundred feet in height, divided
into four stories, and flanked by four octagonal turrets; and is
raised on ponderous arches, forming spacious vaults, which extend
through the angles of the building, into the bases of the
turrets. <a name="citation87"></a><a href="#footnote87"
class="citation">[87]</a>&nbsp; Under the crown of these vaults
was a deep well, which is now filled up.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The walls are of great thickness, particularly that on the
east side, in which are several galleries and narrow rooms,
arched in a curious manner, through which communications were
obtained with the principal apartments in the several stories,
from the great stairs in the south-east turret.&nbsp; The east
wall also contains the chimnies.</p>
<p>The windows are of the pointed order, well-proportioned, and
contain tracery; those on the south, west, and north sides are
large, and from them the principal apartments received light;
those on the east are smaller, being designed to give light only
to the rooms and galleries in that wall.</p>
<p>The main walls were carried to the top of the fourth story,
where the tower was covered by a grand platform, or flat roof,
which, together with the several floors, is entirely
destroyed.&nbsp; Surrounding this part of the tower are very deep
machicolations, upon which, and part of the main walls, is a
parapet of great thickness, with arches, intended to protect the
persons employed over the machicolations.&nbsp; Upon these arches
is a second platform, enclosed with a parapet and embrasures;
above which the embattled turrets rise to a considerable height;
three of them terminating in cones covered with lead.&nbsp; The
cone on the fourth turret is demolished.</p>
<p>On the ground floor is an elegantly carved stone chimney
piece, embattled, and ornamented alternately with arms, and
treasury purses with the motto &ldquo;nay je droit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between the castle and the church stands an ancient brick
building, which, from the stile of architecture, appears to be
coeval with the castle, and is now inhabited.&nbsp; On the west
of the castle is another <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>remain, apparently of the same
date.&nbsp; Each of these buildings is situated between the outer
and inner fosse.</p>
<p>The principal entrance to the castle, with its portcullis and
towers, was standing at the north-east corner of the enclosure,
when Buck made his drawing in 1726.</p>
<h3>THE COLLEGIATE CHURCH.</h3>
<p>In the seventeenth year of the reign of Henry the sixth, a
licence was obtained from that monarch, directed to Ralph
Cromwell, Knight, Henry, Bishop of Winchester, Cardinal of
England, William Alnewick, Bishop of Lincoln, John Scroope,
Knight, Walter Hungerford, Knight, Walter Talbois, Esquire, and
William Paston, patrons of the parish church of Tattershall, in
the county of Lincoln, empowering them to convert the said church
into a collegiate church or college, in honour of the Holy
Trinity, the blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Peter the Apostle, Saint
John the Baptist, and Saint John the Evangelist.&nbsp; The
establishment was to consist of seven chaplains, one of whom to
be custos or master, six secular clerks, and six
choristers.&nbsp; The licence further authorized them to erect a
perpetual alms-house on their own ground, being parcel of the
castle and manor of Tattershall, next to the church-yard,
containing ten acres, for thirteen poor persons of both sexes;
with mansion houses and buildings for the said master, chaplains,
clerks, choristers, and their servants; with cloisters,
enclosures, gardens, orchards, and all other conveniences; and to
assign the same to the said master and chaplains; who were to be
a body corporate, and have a common seal for the execution of all
business, with power to sue and be sued, and to purchase, receive
and hold lands, tenements, and other revenues, ecclesiastical or
secular, to the value of &pound;200. per annum, over and above
the advowson and yearly value of the said church of Tattershall,
and the houses and ten acres of land aforesaid, without fine or
fee to the king or his heirs.</p>
<p>The Lord Treasurer, in pursuance of this licence, began to
convert the parish church into a college; but it appears that he
died before it was finished, as, by his will, dated a short time
previous to his decease, he bequeathed his body to be buried in
the collegiate church of Tattershall, until the whole fabrick
should be re-built, and then to be removed into the midst of the
choir.</p>
<p>The church was afterwards finished nearly as it remains at
this <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>time;
and mansion houses and other necessary buildings were erected for
the use of the foundation, as well as the alms houses mentioned
in the licence.&nbsp; Among the inscriptions in the MS. of
Lincolnshire Church Notes, taken by Mr. Gervase Holles, are the
names of several persons who belonged to this establishment.</p>
<p>This college received several benefactions, and its
possessions progressively increased to a considerable
magnitude.&nbsp; In the thirty-sixth year of Henry the eighth,
the whole was granted to Charles, Duke of Suffolk, who at that
time was possessor of the castle and manor.</p>
<p>The church stands about eighty yards east of the castle, near
the outer fosse, and is a beautiful and spacious stone structure
in the form of a cross, consisting of a square tower, a nave with
five arches on a side, and eight clere-story windows placed in
pairs, a transept, and a choir.&nbsp; On the north side is a
porch, on which are sculptured the arms of William of Wainflete,
Bishop of Winchester; formerly there were two porches on the
south side also bearing the arms of the same bishop; but these
have been some time since removed.&nbsp; Over the great eastern
window is a richly ornamented niche, in which a statue once
stood: the wall above the western door is likewise ornamented
with thirteen blank shields.&nbsp; The cloisters, which were on
the south side of the chancel, are entirely demolished.</p>
<p>In the south wall of the choir are three stone stalls and a
piscina, with a cornice charged with various animals; on each
side of the transept is also a piscina.&nbsp; There is a handsome
rood-loft between the nave and choir, now used as a singing
gallery.</p>
<p>The windows of the choir were once enriched with beautiful
stained glass, which was removed in the year 1754, by the Earl of
Exeter, on condition that it should be replaced with plain glass:
but this being neglected to be done, the choir remained about
fifty years with un-glazed windows; and being thus exposed to the
weather, the elegantly carved oak stalls, the rich screens, and
other ornamental work, fell entirely to decay. <a
name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; The choir has, within these few
years, been repaired by the present Earl Fortescue, and fitted up
in a plain but neat manner.</p>
<p>The windows of the nave and transept were also enriched with
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>stained
glass containing the legendary histories of St. Guthlake, St.
Catherine, and other saints, a few fine fragments of which are
preserved in two of the transept windows.</p>

<p>On the floor before the communion table is a stone which once
contained a rich brass figure of the Lord Treasurer Cromwell,
habited in full plated armour and a flowing mantle and cordon,
the gauntlets reaching to the middle joint of the fingers, a long
sword across him from the middle of the belt, and at his feet two
wild men with clubs his supporters; by his side the figure of
Margaret his wife; and over them a canopy charged with saints,
and under them the following inscription in black letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet nobilis Baro Radulphus Cromwell

</blockquote>
<p>The whole of these figures, the canopy, and the arms are gone,
and only half the inscription is now remaining.</p>
<p>On the north side of the Lord Treasurer, is the figure in
brass of Joan Lady Cromwell, <a name="citation91a"></a><a

adorned with saints, and under her this inscription in black
letter:</p>

<p>On the other side of the Lord Treasurer is the figure in brass
of Matilda Lady Willoughby, <a name="citation91b"></a><a
href="#footnote91b" class="citation">[91b]</a> under a canopy
charged with saints, and at her feet the following inscription in
black letter:</p>

<p>The corner shields from this stone, and also those from that
of Joan Lady Cromwell are gone.&nbsp; The canopies have sustained
but little injury.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>In the
middle of the floor of the choir is the figure in brass of a
priest, under which is the following inscription, in black
letter, to the memory of William Moor, the second provost of this
college:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vir virtute vivens Will&rsquo;us vulgo

</blockquote>
<p>A brass figure of a priest, about five feet long, with the
figure of the deity on his breast, and several saints down his
robe, is now loose in the choir.&nbsp; Mr. Gough, in his
&ldquo;Sepulchral Monuments,&rdquo; describes this as the figure
of William Moor, and attached to the above inscription. <a
name="citation92a"></a><a href="#footnote92a"
class="citation">[92a]</a></p>
<p>On the floor between the nave and the choir is a brass figure
much worn, under which, though scarcely legible, is this
inscription in black letter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hic jacet Hugo . . . quondam . . .

<p>In various parts of the floor of this church are traces of
brass <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

the door in the north aisle appears to have been exceedingly
rich.</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>The

How, D.D. a man of considerable learning, and the author of

the church of Boston, of which he was vicar.&nbsp; It was
afterwards held for more than forty years by the Reverend Michael
Taylor, who died in 1730, and was buried in the midst of the nave
of this church.</p>
<p>The college, which was situated on the north side of the
church, is entirely gone.&nbsp; The alm-houses still remain with
a small endowment.</p>
<p>An old building in the town, supposed to have been the parish
chapel, now forms part of a malting office.</p>
<h3>THE TOWN.</h3>
<p>The parish of Tattershall contains about 1555 acres of land,
and the hamlet of Tattershall Thorpe about 2589 acres, the
principal part of which is the property of the lord of the
manor.</p>
<p>The town has derived considerable benefit from the navigable
canal, which passes through it from the river Witham to the town
of Horncastle.&nbsp; A fine bridge of three arches having been
thrown over the Witham, in the place of the ferry, with a
turnpike road to Sleaford, has also contributed to the
improvement of the place.</p>
<p>From a manuscript account of the diocese of Lincoln, taken in
the year 1588, it appears that at that period Tattershall
contained 236 families, and the hamlet of Tattershall Thorpe
68.&nbsp; By the returns made in the year 1821, it appears that
the number of houses in Tattershall was 120, and of inhabitants
627: Tattershall Thorpe, at the same time, contained 39 houses,
and 269 inhabitants.</p>
<p>There are two fairs holden annually at this place; one on the
fifteenth of May, the other on the twenty-fifth of
September.&nbsp; The market is now held on Friday weekly.</p>
<p>In the market place stands an octagonal column or shaft, which
was once surmounted by a cross.&nbsp; The cross has however long
since been removed and an urn substituted in its place.&nbsp; On
three of the shields with which this column is ornamented these
arms are sculptured, viz. <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span>,
<span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> and <span
class="smcap">Tateshall</span> quarterly, and <span
class="smcap">Cromwell</span> and <span
class="smcap">Tateshall</span> impaling <span
class="smcap">Deincourt</span>.&nbsp; The arms on the fourth
shield are obliterated.</p>
<h2><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>TOWER
ON THE MOOR.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> an extensive moor, about four
miles north of Tattershall, and about six miles south west of
Horncastle, stands the remain of a brick building, called from
its situation the <i>Tower on the Moor</i>.&nbsp; It was built by
the Lord Treasurer Cromwell, and is supposed to have been an
appendage to the castle at Tattershall, from which place it is
plainly visible, by reason of the flatness of the intervening
country. <a name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"

</a></p>
<p>Of this tower only an octangular turret remains, to which
fragments of the walls adhere; it is about sixty feet in height,
and contains winding stairs of brick, now in a very ruinous
condition.&nbsp; Traces of the fosse, by which it was surrounded,
are still visible.</p>

97</span>GEOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span><br />
SOKE AND NEIGHBOURHOOD OF HORNCASTLE.</h2>
<h3>GEOLOGY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the Soke of Horncastle
does not possess much variety in its geological structure, yet a
considerable diversity is to be found in the formation of the
adjacent elevated country, called the wolds.&nbsp; On the annexed
map the denudations of the various strata in this district are
traced out, and distinguished by different colours: the order of
stratification is also exemplified by a section, of imaginary
elevation, but on the same scale as the map with respect to
horizontal distance.&nbsp; The section too shows a greater extent
than the map to the east, where, on account of the dip of the
strata towards that quarter, it is necessary to commence the
description; although in point of distance it cannot be properly
considered within the prescribed limits of this work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p97b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Geological Map"
title=
"Geological Map"
 src="images/p97s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The tract of marsh land between the sea and the wolds, (No.
1.) consists principally of unstratified clay, with admixtures of
sand, and various marine depositions.&nbsp; These circumstances,
together with the old sea banks, evidence that this mass of earth
has been left by the gradual receding of the ocean.</p>
<p>On the west of these marshes is the rough elevated denudation
of chalk, (No. 2.) which forms the highest stratum of the wolds,
and gently dips underneath the marshes; for in boring in them for
water the chalk is always found.&nbsp; The chalk is of two
colours, white and red, each lying in regular strata, which
alternate frequently, the red bearing but a small proportion to
the white.&nbsp; In the white, compact seams of flint, of a light
grey color, from two to six inches thick, are often met
with.&nbsp; In the chalk several extraneous fossils are
found.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>The
stratum immediately below the chalk, (No. 3.) is a coarse, brown,
pebbly sand, consisting of quartz and oxyd of iron, varying in
thickness from six to ten yards, and of uncertain appearance at
its denudation.&nbsp; While the different strata in these parts
were exposed to the action of the water, the sand would naturally
be more affected by that element than the superincumbent stratum
of chalk; and the latter being thus left projecting, would from
the decomposing effects of the atmosphere, crumble down, and form
those various declivities which now present themselves to
view.</p>
<p>Beneath the sand is a bed, about fourteen yards in thickness,
(No. 4.) containing equal proportions of oolite limestone and
calcareous clay of a light grey colour.&nbsp; In some parts the
stone is divided by the clay into regular strata, whilst in
others it occurs in large detached pieces imbedded in the
clay.&nbsp; Fossil shells, and lumps of pyrites, or sulphuret of
iron, are frequently met with in the stone.</p>
<p>The next stratum (No. 5.) consists of grains of quartz, for
the most part agglutinated into sandstone of different degrees of
induration, and varying in colour from a light grey to a dark
brown, whilst in some parts loose sand predominates.&nbsp; In the
grey variety of this stone, marine shells of different kinds, are
found in great abundance: in the brown they occur very seldom,
and not at all in the sand.&nbsp; This stratum is considerably
thicker than the two incumbent ones.</p>
<p>Beneath this is the shale, <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a> (No. 6.) which
generally makes its appearance in vallies; but it no where
exhibits a denudated termination.&nbsp; On sinking a shaft in the
parish of Woodhall, about six miles south-west of Horncastle, it
was found to be one hundred and fifty yards in thickness.&nbsp; A
great variety of organic remains are also found in this
stratum.</p>
<p>Under the shale is a stratum of forest marble, which denudates
about sixteen miles westward of Horncastle.</p>
<p>The last division to be considered is an alluvial collection
of earth, almost entirely consisting of the spoils of the
neighbouring strata in a state of decomposition, wherein however
detached pieces of the different strata are to be found
unaltered.&nbsp; From this it appears that when these parts were
deluged by the water, the current set in from east to west.&nbsp;
As the chalk and the shale would present the largest surfaces <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>to the
erosion of the water, they would be more extensively acted upon
than the other strata: hence the greatest part of the alluvial
deposition consists of white marle and blue; the former (No. 7.)
being of the least specific gravity, has covered the hills, while
the latter with sand and gravel (No. 8.) occupies the lower
parts.</p>
<h3>NATURAL HISTORY.</h3>
<p>In the department of Natural History, this district possesses
but little which is deserving of particular notice.</p>
<p>Of <span class="smcap">Birds</span> there are none which can
now be considered peculiar to this part, the drainage of the fen
lands having entirely banished the great variety of aquatic birds
which used, previous to that event, to be found here.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Plants</span>, indigenous to this
district, are very numerous.&nbsp; From a list of several
hundreds which are to be found in the neighbourhood, the

Burnham in Buckinghamshire, educated at Eton, and elected a
scholar of King&rsquo;s college, Cambridge, in 1507, where he
took the degree of M.A. afterwards became proctor of the
university, schoolmaster of Eton; fellow of the college, and at
length provost.&nbsp; In 1523 he was one of those who were sent
out by the university of Cambridge to preach in different parts
of the nation, as the judges now go their circuits.&nbsp; In 1529
he retired to Oxford, where he was incorporated B.D.&nbsp; About
the same time he was made archdeacon of Colchester.&nbsp; In 1534
he was installed canon of Windsor, and the same year he was
appointed register of the most noble order of the garter.&nbsp;
July 18, 1537, he was consecrated bishop of Carlisle.&nbsp; He
was a correspondent of Erasmus, who termed him when young,
&ldquo;bland&aelig; eloquenti&aelig; juvenis,&rdquo; and appears
to have associated with him during his residence at
Cambridge.&nbsp; Leland was his familiar acquaintance, and gives
him a high character for parts and learning.&nbsp; He was the
author of a volume of epigrams, and several theological
treatises.</p>

only a colonel, and by no means an illustrious individual in the

Champion, in his full suit of armour, mounted on a horse richly

<p>At the entrance into the Hall, the Trumpets sounded thrice,
and the passage to the King&rsquo;s table being cleared by the
Knight Marshal, the Herald with a loud voice proclaimed the
Champion&rsquo;s Challenge, in the words following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any person, of what degree soever, high or low,
shall deny or gainsay our sovereign lord King George the fourth,
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, defender of
the faith, son and next heir to our sovereign lord King George
the third, the last king, deceased, to be right heir to the
imperial crown of this United Kingdom, or that he ought not to
enjoy the same, here is his Champion, who saith that he lieth,
and is a false traitor, being ready in person to combat with him,
and in this quarrel will adventure his life against him on what
day soever he shall be appointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the Champion threw down his gauntlet; which, having
lain a short time upon the ground, the Herald took it up, and
delivered it again to the Champion.</p>
<p>They then advanced to the middle of the Hall, where the
ceremony was again performed in the same manner.</p>
<p>Lastly, they advanced to the steps of the throne, where the
Herald (and those who preceded him) ascending to the middle of
the steps, proclaimed the challenge in the like manner; when the
Champion having thrown down his gauntlet and received it again
from the Herald, made a low obeisance to the King: whereupon the
Cupbearer, having received from the Officer of the Jewel-House, a
Gold Cup and Cover filled with Wine, presented the same to the
King, and his Majesty drank to the Champion, and sent to him by
the Cupbearer the said Cup, which the Champion (having put on his
gauntlet) received, and having made a low obeisance to the King,
and drank the Wine; after which, making another low obeisance to
his Majesty, and being accompanied as before, he departed out of
the Hall, taking with him the said cup and cover as his fee.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The castle of Bullingbrooke was built by
William de Romara, Earle of Lincolne, and ennobled by the birth
of King Henry the 4th, who from thence took his sirname.&nbsp;
Heretofore it was a famous structure, but now gone much to ruine
and decay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The towne standes in a bottome, and the castell in the
lowest part of it, compassed about with a large moat fed by
springs.&nbsp; It is most accessible on the south-west part, the
rest being encompassed by the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the frame of the building, it lieth in a square,
the area within the walls conteyning about an acre and a half,
the building is very uniforme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It hath 4 strongc forts or ramparts, wherein are many
roomes, and lodgings: the passage from one to another lying upon
the walles, which are embattled about.&nbsp; There be likewise 2
watch-towers all covered with lead.&nbsp; If all the roomes in it
were repayred, and furnished [as it seemes in former tymes they
have bin] it were capable to receyve a very great prince with all
his trayne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entrance into it is very stately over a faire
draw-bridge.&nbsp; The gatehouse a very uniforme, and strong
building.&nbsp; Next within the porter&rsquo;s lodge is a payre
of low stayres, which goe downe into a dungeon, in which some
reliques are yet to be seene of a prison-house.&nbsp; Other 2
prisons more are on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The building itselfe is of a sandy stone hewen of a
great square out of the rockes thereby, which though it abide the
weather longe, yet [in processe of tyme] it will moulder,
especially if wett gett within it, which hath bin the decay of
many places of the wall where the roofe is uncovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be certaine roomes within the castle, [built by
Queen Elizabeth of freestone] amongst which is a fayre great
chamber with other lodgings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a roome in one of the towers of the castle they
usually kept their auditt once by the yeare for the whole Dutchy
of Lancaster, having ever bin the prime seate thereof, where all
the recordes for the whole countrey are kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The constable of the castle is Sir William Mounson Lord
Castlemayne, who receaveth a revenue out of the Dutchy lands of
&pound;500. per annum, in part of payment of &pound;1000. yearely
given by the king to the Countesse of Nottingham his lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thinge is not to be passed by affirmed as a
certaine trueth by many of the inhabitants of the towne upon
their owne knowledge, which is, that the castle is haunted by a
certain spirit in the likenesse of a hare: which att the meeting
of the auditors doeth usually runne betweene their legs, and
sometymes overthrows them, and soe passes away.&nbsp; They have
pursued it downe into the castleyard, and seene it take in att a
grate into a low cellar, and have followed it thither with a
light, where notwithstanding that they did most narrowly observe
it [and that there was noe other passage out, but by the doore,
or windowe, the roome being all close framed of stones within,
not having the least chinke or crevice] yet they could never
finde it.&nbsp; And att other tymes it hath been seene run in at
iron-grates below into other of the grotto&rsquo;s [as their be
many of them] and they have watched the place, and sent for
houndes, and put in after it; but after a while they have come
crying out.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
